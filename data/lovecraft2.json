and my uncle showed some sharpness in replying, for the conspicuous freshness of the tablet implied kinship with anything but archeology.", "Young Wilcox's rejoinder, which impressed my uncle enough to make him recall and record it verbatim, was of a fantastically poetic cast which must have typified his whole conversation, and which I have since found highly characteristic of him.", "He said, \"It is new, indeed, for I made it last night in a dream of strange cities; and dreams are older than brooding Tyre, or the contemplative Sphinx, or garden\u2013girdled Babylon.\"", "It was then that he began that rambling tale which suddenly played upon a sleeping memory and won the fevered interest of my uncle.", "There had been a slight earthquake tremor the night before, the most considerable felt in New England for some years; and Wilcox's imagination had been keenly affected.", "Upon retiring, he had had an unprecedented dream of great Cyclopean cities of Titan blocks and sky\u2013flung monoliths, all dripping with green ooze and sinister with latent horror.", "Hieroglyphics had covered the walls and pillars, and from some undetermined point below had come a voice that was not a voice; a chaotic sensation which only fancy could transmute into sound, but which he attempted to render by the almost unpronounceable jumble of letters: \"Cthulhu fhtagn.\"", "This verbal jumble was the key to the recollection which excited and disturbed Professor Angell.", "He questioned the sculptor with scientific minuteness; and studied with frantic intensity the bas\u2013relief on which the youth had found himself working, chilled and clad only in his night clothes, when waking had stolen bewilderingly over him.", "My uncle blamed his old age, Wilcox afterwards said, for his slowness in recognizing both hieroglyphics and pictorial design.", "Many of his questions seemed highly out of place to his visitor, especially those which tried to connect the latter with strange cults or societies; and Wilcox could not understand the repeated promises of silence which he was offered in exchange for an admission of membership in some widespread mystical or paganly religious body.", "When Professor Angell became convinced that the sculptor was indeed ignorant of any cult or system of cryptic lore, he besieged his visitor with demands for future reports of dreams.", "This bore regular fruit, for after the first interview the manuscript records daily calls of the young man, during which he related startling fragments of nocturnal imagery whose burden was always some terrible Cyclopean vista of dark and dripping stone, with a subterrene voice or intelligence shouting monotonously in enigmatical sense\u2013impacts uninscribable save as gibberish.", "The two sounds frequently repeated are those rendered by the letters \"Cthulhu\" and \"R'lyeh.\"", "On March 23, the manuscript continued, Wilcox failed to appear; and inquiries at his quarters revealed that he had been stricken with an obscure sort of fever and taken to the home of his family in Waterman Street.", "He had cried out in the night, arousing several other artists in the building, and had manifested since then only alternations of unconsciousness and delirium.", "My uncle at once telephoned the family, and from that time forward kept close watch of the case; calling often at the Thayer Street office of Dr. Tobey, whom he learned to be in charge.", "The youth's febrile mind, apparently, was dwelling on strange things; and the doctor shuddered now and then as he spoke of them.", "They included not only a repetition of what he had formerly dreamed, but touched wildly on a gigantic thing \"miles high\" which walked or lumbered about.", "He at no time fully described this object but occasional frantic words, as repeated by Dr. Tobey, convinced the professor that it must be identical with the nameless monstrosity he had sought to depict in his dream\u2013sculpture.", "Reference to this object, the doctor added, was invariably a prelude to the young man's subsidence into lethargy.", "His temperature, oddly enough, was not greatly above normal; but the whole condition was otherwise such as to suggest true fever rather than mental disorder.", "On April 2 at about 3 P.M. every trace of Wilcox's malady suddenly ceased.", "He sat upright in bed, astonished to find himself at home and completely ignorant of what had happened in dream or reality since the night of March 22.", "Pronounced well by his physician, he returned to his quarters in three days; but to Professor Angell he was of no further assistance.", "All traces of strange dreaming had vanished with his recovery, and my uncle kept no record of his night\u2013thoughts after a week of pointless and irrelevant accounts of thoroughly usual visions.", "Here the first part of the manuscript ended, but references to certain of the scattered notes gave me much material for thought\u2014so much, in fact, that only the ingrained skepticism then forming my philosophy can account for my continued distrust of the artist.", "The notes in question were those descriptive of the dreams of various persons covering the same period as that in which young Wilcox had had his strange visitations.", "My uncle, it seems, had quickly instituted a prodigiously far\u2013flung body of inquires amongst nearly all the friends whom he could question without impertinence, asking for nightly reports of their dreams, and the dates of any notable visions for some time past.", "The reception of his request seems to have varied; but he must, at the very least, have received more responses than any ordinary man could have handled without a secretary.", "This original correspondence was not preserved, but his notes formed a thorough and really significant digest.", "Average people in society and business\u2014New England's traditional \"salt of the earth\" \u2014gave an almost completely negative result, though scattered cases of uneasy but formless nocturnal impressions appear here and there, always between March 23 and April 2\u2014the period of young Wilcox's delirium.", "Scientific men were little more affected, though four cases of vague description suggest fugitive glimpses of strange landscapes, and in one case there is mentioned a dread of something abnormal.", "It was from the artists and poets that the pertinent answers came, and I know that panic would have broken loose had they been able to compare notes.", "As it was, lacking their original letters, I half suspected the compiler of having asked leading questions, or of having edited the correspondence in corroboration of what he had latently resolved to see.", "That is why I continued to feel that Wilcox, somehow cognizant of the old data which my uncle had possessed, had been imposing on the veteran scientist.", "These responses from esthetes told disturbing tale.", "From February 28 to April 2 a large proportion of them had dreamed very bizarre things, the intensity of the dreams being immeasurably the stronger during the period of the sculptor's delirium.", "Over a fourth of those who reported anything, reported scenes and half\u2013sounds not unlike those which Wilcox had described; and some of the dreamers confessed acute fear of the gigantic nameless thing visible toward the last.", "One case, which the note describes with emphasis, was very sad.", "The subject, a widely known architect with leanings toward theosophy and occultism, went violently insane on the date of young Wilcox's seizure, and expired several months later after incessant screamings to be saved from some escaped denizen of hell.", "Had my uncle referred to these cases by name instead of merely by number, I should have attempted some corroboration and personal investigation; but as it was, I succeeded in tracing down only a few.", "All of these, however, bore out the notes in full.", "I have often wondered if all the objects of the professor's questioning felt as puzzled as did this fraction.", "It is well that no explanation shall ever reach them.", "The press cuttings, as I have intimated, touched on cases of panic, mania, and eccentricity during the given period.", "Professor Angell must have employed a cutting bureau, for the number of extracts was tremendous, and the sources scattered throughout the globe.", "Here was a nocturnal suicide in London, where a lone sleeper had leaped from a window after a shocking cry.", "Here likewise a rambling letter to the editor of a paper in South America, where a fanatic deduces a dire future from visions he has seen.", "A dispatch from California describes a theosophist colony as donning white robes en masse for some \"glorious fulfillment\" which never arrives, whilst items from India speak guardedly of serious native unrest toward the end of March 22\u201323.", "The west of Ireland, too, is full of wild rumor and legendry, and a fantastic painter named Ardois\u2013Bonnot hangs a blasphemous Dream Landscape in the Paris spring salon of 1926.", "And so numerous are the recorded troubles in insane asylums that only a miracle can have stopped the medical fraternity from noting strange parallelisms and drawing mystified conclusions.", "A weird bunch of cuttings, all told; and I can at this date scarcely envisage the callous rationalism with which I set them aside.", "But I was then convinced that young Wilcox had known of the older matters mentioned by the professor.", "The older matters which had made the sculptor's dream and bas\u2013relief so significant to my uncle formed the subject of the second half of his long manuscript.", "Once before, it appears, Professor Angell had seen the hellish outlines of the nameless monstrosity, puzzled over the unknown hieroglyphics, and heard the ominous syllables which can be rendered only as \"Cthulhu\"; and all this in so stirring and horrible a connection that it is small wonder he pursued young Wilcox with queries and demands for data.", "This earlier experience had come in 1908, seventeen years before, when the American Archaeological Society held its annual meeting in St. Louis.", "Professor Angell, as befitted one of his authority and attainments, had had a prominent part in all the deliberations; and was one of the first to be approached by the several outsiders who took advantage of the convocation to offer questions for correct answering and problems for expert solution.", "The chief of these outsiders, and in a short time the focus of interest for the entire meeting, was a commonplace\u2013looking middle\u2013aged man who had traveled all the way from New Orleans for certain special information unobtainable from any local source.", "His name was John Raymond Legrasse, and he was by profession an Inspector of Police.", "With him he bore the subject of his visit, a grotesque, repulsive, and apparently very ancient stone statuette whose origin he was at a loss to determine.", "It must not be fancied that Inspector Legrasse had the least interest in archaeology.", "On the contrary, his wish for enlightenment was prompted by purely professional considerations.", "The statuette, idol, fetish, or whatever it was, had been captured some months before in the wooded swamps south of New Orleans during a raid on a supposed voodoo meeting; and so singular and hideous were the rites connected with it, that the police could not but realize that they had stumbled on a dark cult totally unknown to them, and infinitely more diabolic than even the blackest of the African voodoo circles.", "Of its origin, apart from the erratic and unbelievable tales extorted from the captured members, absolutely nothing was to be discovered; hence the anxiety of the police for any antiquarian lore which might help them to place the frightful symbol, and through it track down the cult to its fountain\u2013head.", "Inspector Legrasse was scarcely prepared for the sensation which his offering created.", "One sight of the thing had been enough to throw the assembled men of science into a state of tense excitement, and they lost no time in crowding around him to gaze at the diminutive figure whose utter strangeness and air of genuinely abysmal antiquity hinted so potently at unopened and archaic vistas.", "No recognized school of sculpture had animated this terrible object, yet centuries and even thousands of years seemed recorded in its dim and greenish surface of unplaceable stone.", "The figure, which was finally passed slowly from man to man for close and careful study, was between seven and eight inches in height, and of exquisitely artistic workmanship.", "It represented a monster of vaguely anthropoid outline, but with an octopus\u2013like head whose face was a mass of feelers, a scaly, rubbery\u2013looking body, prodigious claws on hind and fore feet, and long, narrow wings behind.", "This thing, which seemed instinct with a fearsome and unnatural malignancy, was of a somewhat bloated corpulence, and squatted evilly on a rectangular block or pedestal covered with undecipherable characters.", "The tips of the wings touched the back edge of the block, the seat occupied the center, whilst the long, curved claws of the doubled\u2013up, crouching hind legs gripped the front edge and extended a quarter of the way clown toward the bottom of the pedestal.", "The cephalopod head was bent forward, so that the ends of the facial feelers brushed the backs of huge fore paws which clasped the croucher's elevated knees.", "The aspect of the whole was abnormally life\u2013like, and the more subtly fearful because its source was so totally unknown.", "Its vast, awesome, and incalculable age was unmistakable; yet not one link did it show with any known type of art belonging to civilization's youth\u2014or indeed to any other time.", "Totally separate and apart, its very material was a mystery; for the soapy, greenish\u2013black stone with its golden or iridescent flecks and striations resembled nothing familiar to geology or mineralogy.", "The characters along the base were equally baffling; and no member present, despite a representation of half the world's expert learning in this field, could form the least notion of even their remotest linguistic kinship.", "They, like the subject and material, belonged to something horribly remote and distinct from mankind as we know it.", "something frightfully suggestive of old and unhallowed cycles of life in which our world and our conceptions have no part.", "And yet, as the members severally shook their heads and confessed defeat at the Inspector's problem, there was one man in that gathering who suspected a touch of bizarre familiarity in the monstrous shape and writing, and who presently told with some diffidence of the odd trifle he knew.", "This person was the late William Channing Webb, Professor of Anthropology in Princeton University, and an explorer of no slight note.", "Professor Webb had been engaged, forty\u2013eight years before, in a tour of Greenland and Iceland in search of some Runic inscriptions which he failed to unearth; and whilst high up on the West Greenland coast had encountered a singular tribe or cult of degenerate Esquimaux whose religion, a curious form of devil\u2013worship, chilled him with its deliberate bloodthirstiness and repulsiveness.", "It was a faith of which other Esquimaux knew little, and which they mentioned only with shudders, saying that it had come down from horribly ancient aeons before ever the world was made.", "Besides nameless rites and human sacrifices there were certain queer hereditary rituals addressed to a supreme elder devil or tornasuk; and of this Professor Webb had taken a careful phonetic copy from an aged angekok or wizard\u2013priest, expressing the sounds in Roman letters as best he knew how.", "But just now of prime significance was the fetish which this cult had cherished, and around which they danced when the aurora leaped high over the ice cliffs.", "It was, the professor stated, a very crude bas\u2013relief of stone, comprising a hideous picture and some cryptic writing.", "And so far as he could tell, it was a rough parallel in all essential features of the bestial thing now lying before the meeting.", "This data, received with suspense and astonishment by the assembled members, proved doubly exciting to Inspector Legrasse; and he began at once to ply his informant with questions.", "Having noted and copied an oral ritual among the swamp cult\u2013worshipers his men had arrested, he besought the professor to remember as best he might the syllables taken down amongst the diabolist Esquimaux.", "There then followed an exhaustive comparison of details, and a moment of really awed silence when both detective and scientist agreed on the virtual identity of the phrase common to two hellish rituals so many worlds of distance apart.", "What, in substance, both the Esquimaux wizards and the Louisiana swamp\u2013priests had chanted to their kindred idols was something very like this: the word\u2013divisions being guessed at from traditional breaks in the phrase as chanted aloud:\n\n\t\"Ph'nglui mglw'nafh Cthulhu R'lyeh wgah'nagl fhtagn.\"", "Legrasse had one point in advance of Professor Webb, for several among his mongrel prisoners had repeated to him what older celebrants had told them the words meant.", "This text, as given, ran something like this:\n\n\t\"In his house at R'lyeh dead Cthulhu waits dreaming.\"", "And now, in response to a general and urgent demand, Inspector Legrasse related as fully as possible his experience with the swamp worshipers; telling a story to which I could see my uncle attached profound significance.", "It savored of the wildest dreams of myth\u2013maker and theosophist, and disclosed an astonishing degree of cosmic imagination among such half\u2013castes and pariahs as might be least expected to possess it.", "On November 1st, 1907, there had come to the New Orleans police a frantic summons from the swamp and lagoon country to the south.", "The squatters there, mostly primitive but good\u2013natured descendants of Lafitte's men, were in the grip of stark terror from an unknown thing which had stolen upon them in the night.", "It was voodoo, apparently, but voodoo of a more terrible sort than they had ever known; and some of their women and children had disappeared since the malevolent tom\u2013tom had begun its incessant beating far within the black haunted woods where no dweller ventured.", "There were insane shouts and harrowing screams, soul\u2013chilling chants and dancing devil\u2013flames; and, the frightened messenger added, the people could stand it no more.", "So a body of twenty police, filling two carriages and an automobile, had set out in the late afternoon with the shivering squatter as a guide.", "At the end of the passable road they alighted, and for miles splashed on in silence through the terrible cypress woods where day never came.", "Ugly roots and malignant hanging nooses of Spanish moss beset them, and now and then a pile of dank stones or fragment of a rotting wall intensified by its hint of morbid habitation a depression which every malformed tree and every fungous islet combined to create.", "At length the squatter settlement, a miserable huddle of huts, hove in sight; and hysterical dwellers ran out to cluster around the group of bobbing lanterns.", "The muffled beat of tom\u2013toms was now faintly audible far, far ahead; and a curdling shriek came at infrequent intervals when the wind shifted.", "A reddish glare, too, seemed to filter through pale undergrowth beyond the endless avenues of forest night.", "Reluctant even to be left alone again, each one of the cowed squatters refused point\u2013blank to advance another inch toward the scene of unholy worship, so Inspector Legrasse and his nineteen colleagues plunged on unguided into black arcades of horror that none of them had ever trod before.", "The region now entered by the police was one of traditionally evil repute, substantially unknown and untraversed by white men.", "There were legends of a hidden lake unglimpsed by mortal sight, in which dwelt a huge, formless white polypous thing with luminous eyes; and squatters whispered that bat\u2013winged devils flew up out of caverns in inner earth to worship it at midnight.", "They said it had been there before d'Iberville, before La Salle, before the Indians, and before even the wholesome beasts and birds of the woods.", "It was nightmare itself, and to see it was to die.", "But it made men dream, and so they knew enough to keep away.", "The present voodoo orgy was, indeed, on the merest fringe of this abhorred area, but that location was bad enough; hence perhaps the very place of the worship had terrified the squatters more than the shocking sounds and incidents.", "Only poetry or madness could do justice to the noises heard by Legrasse's men as they ploughed on through the black morass toward the red glare and muffled tom\u2013toms.", "There are vocal qualities peculiar to men, and vocal qualities peculiar to beasts; and it is terrible to hear the one when the source should yield the other.", "Animal fury and orgiastic license here whipped themselves to daemoniac heights by howls and squawking ecstasies that tore and reverberated through those nighted woods like pestilential tempests from the gulfs of hell.", "Now and then the less organized ululation would cease, and from what seemed a well\u2013drilled chorus of hoarse voices would rise in sing\u2013song chant that hideous phrase or ritual:\n\n\t\"Ph'nglui mglw'nafh Cthulhu R'lyeh wgah'nagl fhtagn.\"", "Then the men, having reached a spot where the trees were thinner, came suddenly in sight of the spectacle itself.", "Four of them reeled, one fainted, and two were shaken into a frantic cry which the mad cacophony of the orgy fortunately deadened.", "Legrasse dashed swamp water on the face of the fainting man, and all stood trembling and nearly hypnotized with horror.", "In a natural glade of the swamp stood a grassy island of perhaps an acre's extent, clear of trees and tolerably dry.", "On this now leaped and twisted a more indescribable horde of human abnormality than any but a Sime or an Angarola could paint.", "Void of clothing, this hybrid spawn were braying, bellowing, and writhing about a monstrous ring\u2013shaped bonfire; in the center of which, revealed by occasional rifts in the curtain of flame, stood a great granite monolith some eight feet in height; on top of which, incongruous in its diminutiveness, rested the noxious carven statuette.", "From a wide circle of ten scaffolds set up at regular intervals with the flame\u2013girt monolith as a center hung, head downward, the oddly marred bodies of the helpless squatters who had disappeared.", "It was inside this circle that the ring of worshipers jumped and roared, the general direction of the mass motion being from left to right in endless Bacchanal between the ring of bodies and the ring of fire.", "It may have been only imagination and it may have been only echoes which induced one of the men, an excitable Spaniard, to fancy he heard antiphonal responses to the ritual from some far and unillumined spot deeper within the wood of ancient legendry and horror.", "This man, Joseph D. Galvez, I later met and questioned; and he proved distractingly imaginative.", "He indeed went so far as to hint of the faint beating of great wings, and of a glimpse of shining eyes and a mountainous white bulk beyond the remotest trees but I suppose he had been hearing too much native superstition.", "Actually, the horrified pause of the men was of comparatively brief duration.", "Duty came first; and although there must have been nearly a hundred mongrel celebrants in the throng, the police relied on their firearms and plunged determinedly into the nauseous rout.", "For five minutes the resultant din and chaos were beyond description.", "Wild blows were struck, shots were fired, and escapes were made; but in the end Legrasse was able to count some forty\u2013seven sullen prisoners, whom he forced to dress in haste and fall into line between two rows of policemen.", "Five of the worshipers lay dead, and two severely wounded ones were carried away on improvised stretchers by their fellow\u2013 prisoners.", "The image on the monolith, of course, was carefully removed and carried back by Legrasse.", "Examined at headquarters after a trip of intense strain and weariness, the prisoners all proved to be men of a very low, mixed\u2013blooded, and mentally aberrant type.", "Most were seamen, and a sprinkling of Negroes and mulattoes, largely West Indians or Brava Portuguese from the Cape Verde Islands, gave a colouring of voodooism to the heterogeneous cult.", "But before many questions were asked, it became manifest that something far deeper and older than Negro fetishism was involved.", "Degraded and ignorant as they were, the creatures held with surprising consistency to the central idea of their loathsome faith.", "They worshipped, so they said, the Great Old Ones who lived ages before there were any men, and who came to the young world out of the sky.", "Those Old Ones were gone now, inside the earth and under the sea;

though privately I suspected young Wilcox of having heard of the cult in some indirect way, and of having invented a series of dreams to heighten and continue the mystery at my uncle's expense.", "The dream\u2013 narratives and cuttings collected by the professor were, of course, strong corroboration; but the rationalism of my mind and the extravagance of the whole subject led me to adopt what I thought the most sensible conclusions.", "So, after thoroughly studying the manuscript again and correlating the theosophical and anthropological notes with the cult narrative of Legrasse, I made a trip to Providence to see the sculptor and give him the rebuke I thought proper for so boldly imposing upon a learned and aged man.", "Wilcox still lived alone in the Fleur\u2013de\u2013Lys Building in Thomas Street, a hideous Victorian imitation of seventeenth century Breton Architecture which flaunts its stuccoed front amidst the lovely colonial houses on the ancient hill, and under the very shadow of the finest Georgian steeple in America, I found him at work in his rooms, and at once conceded from the specimens scattered about that his genius is indeed profound and authentic.", "He will, I believe, some time be heard from as one of the great decadents; for he has crystallized in clay and will one day mirror in marble those nightmares and fantasies which Arthur Machen evokes in prose, and Clark Ashton Smith makes visible in verse and in painting.", "Dark, frail, and somewhat unkempt in aspect, he turned languidly at my knock and asked me my business without rising.", "Then I told him who I was, he displayed some interest; for my uncle had excited his curiosity in probing his strange dreams, yet had never explained the reason for the study.", "I did not enlarge his knowledge in this regard, but sought with some subtlety to draw him out.", "In a short time I became convinced of his absolute sincerity, for he spoke of the dreams in a manner none could mistake.", "They and their subconscious residuum had influenced his art profoundly, and he showed me a morbid statue whose contours almost made me shake with the potency of its black suggestion.", "He could not recall having seen the original of this thing except in his own dream bas\u2013relief, but the outlines had formed themselves insensibly under his hands.", "It was, no doubt, the giant shape he had raved of in delirium.", "That he really knew nothing of the hidden cult, save from what my uncle's relentless catechism had let fall, he soon made clear; and again I strove to think of some way in which he could possibly have received the weird impressions.", "He talked of his dreams in a strangely poetic fashion; making me see with terrible vividness the damp Cyclopean city of slimy green stone\u2014whose geometry, he oddly said, was all wrong\u2014and hear with frightened expectancy the ceaseless, half\u2013mental calling from underground: \"Cthulhu fhtagn\", \"Cthulhu fhtagn.\"", "These words had formed part of that dread ritual which told of dead Cthulhu's dream\u2013vigil in his stone vault at R'lyeh, and I felt deeply moved despite my rational beliefs.", "Wilcox, I was sure, had heard of the cult in some casual way, and had soon forgotten it amidst the mass of his equally weird reading and imagining.", "Later, by virtue of its sheer impressiveness, it had found subconscious expression in dreams, in the bas\u2013relief, and in the terrible statue I now beheld; so that his imposture upon my uncle had been a very innocent one.", "The youth was of a type, at once slightly affected and slightly ill\u2013mannered, which I could never like, but I was willing enough now to admit both his genius and his honesty.", "I took leave of him amicably, and wish him all the success his talent promises.", "The matter of the cult still remained to fascinate me, and at times I had visions of personal fame from researches into its origin and connections.", "I visited New Orleans, talked with Legrasse and others of that old\u2013time raiding\u2013 party, saw the frightful image, and even questioned such of the mongrel prisoners as still survived.", "Old Castro, unfortunately, had been dead for some years.", "What I now heard so graphically at first\u2013hand, though it was really no more than a detailed confirmation of what my uncle had written, excited me afresh; for I felt sure that I was on the track of a very real, very secret, and very ancient religion whose discovery would make me an anthropologist of note.", "My attitude was still one of absolute materialism, as l wish it still were, and I discounted with almost inexplicable perversity the coincidence of the dream notes and odd cuttings collected by Professor Angell.", "One thing I began to suspect, and which I now fear I know, is that my uncle's death was far from natural.", "He fell on a narrow hill street leading up from an ancient waterfront swarming with foreign mongrels, after a careless push from a Negro sailor.", "I did not forget the mixed blood and marine pursuits of the cult\u2013 members in Louisiana, and would not be surprised to learn of secret methods and rites and beliefs.", "Legrasse and his men, it is true, have been let alone; but in Norway a certain seaman who saw things is dead.", "Might not the deeper inquiries of my uncle after encountering the sculptor's data have come to sinister ears?.", "I think Professor Angell died because he knew too much, or because he was likely to learn too much.", "Whether I shall go as he did remains to be seen, for I have learned much now.", "If heaven ever wishes to grant me a boon, it will be a total effacing of the results of a mere chance which fixed my eye on a certain stray piece of shelf\u2013 paper.", "It was nothing on which I would naturally have stumbled in the course of my daily round, for it was an old number of an Australian journal, the Sydney Bulletin for April 18, 1925.", "It had escaped even the cutting bureau which had at the time of its issuance been avidly collecting material for my uncle's research.", "I had largely given over my inquiries into what Professor Angell called the \"Cthulhu Cult\", and was visiting a learned friend in Paterson, New Jersey; the curator of a local museum and a mineralogist of note.", "Examining one day the reserve specimens roughly set on the storage shelves in a rear room of the museum, my eye was caught by an odd picture in one of the old papers spread beneath the stones.", "It was the Sydney Bulletin I have mentioned, for my friend had wide affiliations in all conceivable foreign parts; and the picture was a half\u2013tone cut of a hideous stone image almost identical with that which Legrasse had found in the swamp.", "Eagerly clearing the sheet of its precious contents, I scanned the item in detail;

and the remaining eight under Second Mate Johansen proceeded to navigate the captured yacht, going ahead in their original direction to see if any reason for their ordering back had existed.", "The next day, it appears, they raised and landed on a small island, although none is known to exist in that part of the ocean; and six of the men somehow died ashore, though Johansen is queerly reticent about this part of his story, and speaks only of their falling into a rock chasm.", "Later, it seems, he and one companion boarded the yacht and tried to manage her, but were beaten about by the storm of April 2nd, From that time till his rescue on the 12th the man remembers little, and he does not even recall when William Briden, his companion, died.", "Briden's death reveals no apparent cause, and was probably due to excitement or exposure.", "Cable advices from Dunedin report that the Alert was well known there as an island trader, and bore an evil reputation along the waterfront, It was owned by a curious group of half\u2013castes whose frequent meetings and night trips to the woods attracted no little curiosity;

for instead of describing any definite structure or building, he dwells only on broad impressions of vast angles and stone surfaces\u2014surfaces too great to belong to anything right or proper for this earth, and impious with horrible images and hieroglyphs.", "I mention his talk about angles because it suggests something Wilcox had told me of his awful dreams.", "He said that the geometry of the dream\u2013place he saw was abnormal, non\u2013 Euclidean, and loathsomely redolent of spheres and dimensions apart from ours.", "Now an unlettered seaman felt the same thing whilst gazing at the terrible reality.", "Johansen and his men landed at a sloping mud\u2013bank on this monstrous Acropolis, and clambered slipperily up over titan oozy blocks which could have been no mortal staircase.", "The very sun of heaven seemed distorted when viewed through the polarizing miasma welling out from this sea\u2013soaked perversion, and twisted menace and suspense lurked leeringly in those crazily elusive angles of carven rock where a second glance showed concavity after the first showed convexity.", "Something very like fright had come over all the explorers before anything more definite than rock and ooze and weed was seen.", "Each would have fled had he not feared the scorn of the others, and it was only half\u2013heartedly that they searched\u2014vainly, as it proved\u2014for some portable souvenir to bear away.", "It was Rodriguez the Portuguese who climbed up the foot of the monolith and shouted of what he had found.", "The rest followed him, and looked curiously at the immense carved door with the now familiar squid\u2013dragon bas\u2013relief.", "It was, Johansen said, like a great barn\u2013door; and they all felt that it was a door because of the ornate lintel, threshold, and jambs around it, though they could not decide whether it lay flat like a trap\u2013door or slantwise like an outside cellar\u2013door.", "As Wilcox would have said, the geometry of the place was all wrong.", "One could not be sure that the sea and the ground were horizontal, hence the relative position of everything else seemed phantasmally variable.", "Briden pushed at the stone in several places without result.", "Then Donovan felt over it delicately around the edge, pressing each point separately as he went.", "He climbed interminably along the grotesque stone moulding\u2014that is, one would call it climbing if the thing was not after all horizontal \u2014and the men wondered how any door in the universe could be so vast.", "Then, very softly and slowly, the acre\u2013great lintel began to give inward at the top; and they saw that it was balanced\n\n\tDonovan slid or somehow propelled himself down or along the jamb and rejoined his fellows, and everyone watched the queer recession of the monstrously carven portal.", "In this phantasy of prismatic distortion it moved anomalously in a diagonal way, so that all the rules of matter and perspective seemed upset.", "The aperture was black with a darkness almost material.", "That tenebrousness was indeed a positive quality; for it obscured such parts of the inner walls as ought to have been revealed, and actually burst forth like smoke from its aeon\u2013 long imprisonment, visibly darkening the sun as it slunk away into the shrunken and gibbous sky on flapping membraneous wings.", "The odor rising from the newly opened depths was intolerable, and at length the quick\u2013eared Hawkins thought he heard a nasty, slopping sound down there.", "Everyone listened, and everyone was listening still when It lumbered slobberingly into sight and gropingly squeezed Its gelatinous green immensity through the black doorway into the tainted outside air of that poison city of madness.", "Poor Johansen's handwriting almost gave out when he wrote of this.", "Of the six men who never reached the ship, he thinks two perished of pure fright in that accursed instant.", "The Thing cannot be described\u2014there is no language for such abysms of shrieking and immemorial lunacy, such eldritch contradictions of all matter, force, and cosmic order.", "A mountain walked or stumbled.", "God!", "What wonder that across the earth a great architect went mad, and poor Wilcox raved with fever in that telepathic instant?", "The Thing of the idols, the green, sticky spawn of the stars, had awaked to claim his own.", "The stars were right again, and what an age\u2013old cult had failed to do by design, a band of innocent sailors had done by accident.", "After vigintillions of years great Cthulhu was loose again, and ravening for delight.", "Three men were swept up by the flabby claws before anybody turned.", "God rest them, if there be any rest in the universe.", "They were Donovan, Guerrera, and Angstrom.", "Parker slipped as the other three were plunging frenziedly over endless vistas of green\u2013crusted rock to the boat, and Johansen swears he was swallowed up by an angle of masonry which shouldn't have been there; an angle which was acute, but behaved as if it were obtuse.", "So only Briden and Johansen reached the boat, and pulled desperately for the Alert as the mountainous monstrosity flopped down the slimy stones and hesitated, floundering at the edge of the water.", "Steam had not been suffered to go down entirely, despite the departure of all hands for the shore; and it was the work of only a few moments of feverish rushing up and down between wheel and engines to get the Alert under way.", "Slowly, amidst the distorted horrors of that indescribable scene, she began to churn the lethal waters;

and Lake, as a biologist, seemed to find their curious marking unusually puzzling and provocative, though to my geological eye it looked not unlike some of the ripple effects reasonably common in the sedimentary rocks.", "Since slate is no more than a metamorphic formation into which a sedimentary stratum is pressed, and since the pressure itself produces odd distorting effects on any markings which may exist, I saw no reason for extreme wonder over the striated depression.", "On January 6th, 1931, Lake, Pabodie, Danforth, the other six students, and myself flew directly over the south pole in two of the great planes, being forced down once by a sudden high wind, which, fortunately, did not develop into a typical storm.", "This was, as the papers have stated, one of several observation flights, during others of which we tried to discern new topographical features in areas unreached by previous explorers.", "Our early flights were disappointing in this latter respect, though they afforded us some magnificent examples of the richly fantastic and deceptive mirages of the polar regions, of which our sea voyage had given us some brief foretastes.", "Distant mountains floated in the sky as enchanted cities, and often the whole white world would dissolve into a gold, silver, and scarlet land of Dunsanian dreams and adventurous expectancy under the magic of the low midnight sun.", "On cloudy days we had considerable trouble in flying owing to the tendency of snowy earth and sky to merge into one mystical opalescent void with no visible horizon to mark the junction of the two.", "At length we resolved to carry out our original plan of flying five hundred miles eastward with all four exploring planes and establishing a fresh sub-base at a point which would probably be on the smaller continental division, as we mistakenly conceived it.", "Geological specimens obtained there would be desirable for purposes of comparison.", "Our health so far had remained excellent\u2014lime juice well offsetting the steady diet of tinned and salted food, and temperatures generally above zero enabling us to do without our thickest furs.", "It was now midsummer, and with haste and care we might be able to conclude work by March and avoid a tedious wintering through the long antarctic night.", "Several savage windstorms had burst upon us from the west, but we had escaped damage through the skill of Atwood in devising rudimentary aeroplane shelters and windbreaks of heavy snow blocks, and reinforcing the principal camp buildings with snow.", "Our good luck and efficiency had indeed been almost uncanny.", "The outside world knew, of course, of our program, and was told also of Lake\u2019s strange and dogged insistence on a westward\u2014or rather, northwestward\u2014prospecting trip before our radical shift to the new base.", "It seems that he had pondered a great deal, and with alarmingly radical daring, over that triangular striated marking in the slate; reading into it certain contradictions in nature and geological period which whetted his curiosity to the utmost, and made him avid to sink more borings and blastings in the west-stretching formation to which the exhumed fragments evidently belonged.", "He was strangely convinced that the marking was the print of some bulky, unknown, and radically unclassifiable organism of considerably advanced evolution, notwithstanding that the rock which bore it was of so vastly ancient a date\u2014Cambrian if not actually pre-Cambrian\u2014as to preclude the probable existence not only of all highly evolved life, but of any life at all above the unicellular or at most the trilobite stage.", "These fragments, with their odd marking, must have been five hundred million to a thousand million years old.", "Chapter 2\n\n\n\n\n\tPopular imagination, I judge, responded actively to our wireless bulletins of Lake\u2019s start northwestward into regions never trodden by human foot or penetrated by human imagination, though we did not mention his wild hopes of revolutionizing the entire sciences of biology and geology.", "His preliminary sledging and boring journey of January 11th to 18th with Pabodie and five others\u2014marred by the loss of two dogs in an upset when crossing one of the great pressure ridges in the ice\u2014had brought up more and more of the Archaean slate; and even I was interested by the singular profusion of evident fossil markings in that unbelievably ancient stratum.", "These markings, however, were of very primitive life forms involving no great paradox except that any life forms should occur in rock as definitely pre-Cambrian as this seemed to be; hence I still failed to see the good sense of Lake\u2019s demand for an interlude in our time-saving program\u2014an interlude requiring the use of all four planes, many men, and the whole of the expedition\u2019s mechanical apparatus.", "I did not, in the end, veto the plan, though I decided not to accompany the northwestward party despite Lake\u2019s plea for my geological advice.", "While they were gone, I would remain at the base with Pabodie and five men and work out final plans for the eastward shift.", "In preparation for this transfer, one of the planes had begun to move up a good gasoline supply from McMurdo Sound;

these being simultaneously picked up by our apparatus at the southern base and by the Arkham at McMurdo Sound, whence they were relayed to the outside world on wave lengths up to fifty meters.", "The start was made January 22nd at 4 A.M., and the first wireless message we received came only two hours later, when Lake spoke of descending and starting a small-scale ice-melting and bore at a point some three hundred miles away from us.", "Six hours after that a second and very excited message told of the frantic, beaver-like work whereby a shallow shaft had been sunk and blasted, culminating in the discovery of slate fragments with several markings approximately like the one which had caused the original puzzlement.", "Three hours later a brief bulletin announced the resumption of the flight in the teeth of a raw and piercing gale; and when I dispatched a message of protest against further hazards, Lake replied curtly that his new specimens made any hazard worth taking.", "I saw that his excitement had reached the point of mutiny, and that I could do nothing to check this headlong risk of the whole expedition\u2019s success;

yet one could not be exact as to the limit of its later adaptations.", "The wings, after all, held a persistent suggestion of the aerial.", "How it could have undergone its tremendously complex evolution on a new-born earth in time to leave prints in Archaean rocks was so far beyond conception as to make Lake whimsically recall the primal myths about Great Old Ones who filtered down from the stars and concocted earth life as a joke or mistake; and the wild tales of cosmic hill things from outside told by a folklorist colleague in Miskatonic\u2019s English department.", "Naturally, he considered the possibility of the pre-Cambrian prints having been made by a less evolved ancestor of the present specimens, but quickly rejected this too-facile theory upon considering the advanced structural qualities of the older fossils.", "If anything, the later contours showed decadence rather than higher evolution.", "The size of the pseudofeet had decreased, and the whole morphology seemed coarsened and simplified.", "Moreover, the nerves and organs just examined held singular suggestions of retrogression from forms still more complex.", "Atrophied and vestigial parts were surprisingly prevalent.", "Altogether, little could be said to have been solved;

but Lake did not believe there was any danger of immediate decomposition in the almost subzero air.", "He did, however, move all the undissected specimens close together and throw a spare tent over them in order to keep off the direct solar rays.", "That would also help to keep their possible scent away from the dogs, whose hostile unrest was really becoming a problem, even at their substantial distance and behind the higher and higher snow walls which an increased quota of the men were hastening to raise around their quarters.", "He had to weight down the corners of the tent cloth with heavy blocks of snow to hold it in place amidst the rising gale, for the titan mountains seemed about to deliver some gravely severe blasts.", "Early apprehensions about sudden antarctic winds were revived, and under Atwood\u2019s supervision precautions were taken to bank the tents, new dog corral, and crude aeroplane shelters with snow on the mountainward side.", "These latter shelters, begun with hard snow blocks during odd moments, were by no means as high as they should have been; and Lake finally detached all hands from other tasks to work on them.", "It was after four when Lake at last prepared to sign off and advised us all to share the rest period his outfit would take when the shelter walls were a little higher.", "He held some friendly chat with Pabodie over the ether, and repeated his praise of the really marvelous drills that had helped him make his discovery.", "Atwood also sent greetings and praises.", "I gave Lake a warm word of congratulations, owning up that he was right about the western trip, and we all agreed to get in touch by wireless at ten in the morning.", "If the gale was then over, Lake would send a plane for the party at my base.", "Just before retiring I dispatched a final message to the Arkham with instructions about toning down the day\u2019s news for the outside world, since the full details seemed radical enough to rouse a wave of incredulity until further substantiated.", "None of us, I imagine, slept very heavily or continuously that morning.", "Both the excitement of Lake\u2019s discovery and the mounting fury of the wind were against such a thing.", "So savage was the blast, even where we were, that we could not help wondering how much worse it was at Lake\u2019s camp, directly under the vast unknown peaks that bred and delivered it.", "McTighe was awake at ten o\u2019clock and tried to get Lake on the wireless, as agreed, but some electrical condition in the disturbed air to the westward seemed to prevent communication.", "We did, however, get the Arkham, and Douglas told me that he had likewise been vainly trying to reach Lake.", "He had not known about the wind, for very little was blowing at McMurdo Sound, despite its persistent rage where we were.", "Throughout the day we all listened anxiously and tried to get Lake at intervals, but invariably without results.", "About noon a positive frenzy of wind stampeded out of the west, causing us to fear for the safety of our camp; but it eventually died down, with only a moderate relapse at 2 P.M. After three o\u2019clock it was very quiet, and we redoubled our efforts to get Lake.", "Reflecting that he had four planes, each provided with an excellent short-wave outfit, we could not imagine any ordinary accident capable of crippling all his wireless equipment at once.", "Nevertheless the stony silence continued, and when we thought of the delirious force the wind must have had in his locality we could not help making the most direful conjectures.", "By six o\u2019clock our fears had become intense and definite, and after a wireless consultation with Douglas and Thorfinnssen I resolved to take steps toward investigation.", "The fifth aeroplane, which we had left at the McMurdo Sound supply cache with Sherman and two sailors, was in good shape and ready for instant use, and it seemed that the very emergency for which it had been saved was now upon us.", "I got Sherman by wireless and ordered him to join me with the plane and the two sailors at the southern base as quickly as possible, the air conditions being apparently highly favorable.", "We then talked over the personnel of the coming investigation party, and decided that we would include all hands, together with the sledge and dogs which I had kept with me.", "Even so great a load would not be too much for one of the huge planes built to our special orders for heavy machinery transportation.", "At intervals I still tried to reach Lake with the wireless, but all to no purpose.", "Sherman, with the sailors Gunnarsson and Larsen, took off at 7:30, and reported a quiet flight from several points on the wing.", "They arrived at our base at midnight, and all hands at once discussed the next move.", "It was risky business sailing over the antarctic in a single aeroplane without any line of bases, but no one drew back from what seemed like the plainest necessity.", "We turned in at two o\u2019clock for a brief rest after some preliminary loading of the plane, but were up again in four hours to finish the loading and packing.", "At 7:15 A.M., January 25th, we started flying northwestward under McTighe\u2019s pilotage with ten men, seven dogs, a sledge, a fuel and food supply, and other items including the plane\u2019s wireless outfit.", "The atmosphere was clear, fairly quiet, and relatively mild in temperature, and we anticipated very little trouble in reaching the latitude and longitude designated by Lake as the site of his camp.", "Our apprehensions were over what we might find, or fail to find, at the end of our journey, for silence continued to answer all calls dispatched to the camp.", "Every incident of that four-and-a-half-hour flight is burned into my recollection because of its crucial position in my life.", "It marked my loss, at the age of fifty-four, of all that peace and balance which the normal mind possesses through its accustomed conception of external nature and nature\u2019s laws.", "Thenceforward the ten of us\u2014but the student Danforth and myself above all others\u2014were to face a hideously amplified world of lurking horrors which nothing can erase from our emotions, and which we would refrain from sharing with mankind in general if we could.", "The newspapers have printed the bulletins we sent from the moving plane, telling of our non-stop course, our two battles with treacherous upper-air gales, our glimpse of the broken surface where Lake had sunk his mid-journey shaft three days before, and our sight of a group of those strange fluffy snow cylinders noted by Amundsen and Byrd as rolling in the wind across the endless leagues of frozen plateau.", "There came a point, though, when our sensations could not be conveyed in any words the press would understand, and a latter point when we had to adopt an actual rule of strict censorship.", "The sailor Larsen was first to spy the jagged line of witch-like cones and pinnacles ahead, and his shouts sent everyone to the windows of the great cabined plane.", "Despite our speed, they were very slow in gaining prominence; hence we knew that they must be infinitely far off, and visible only because of their abnormal height.", "Little by little, however, they rose grimly into the western sky; allowing us to distinguish various bare, bleak, blackish summits, and to catch the curious sense of fantasy which they inspired as seen in the reddish antarctic light against the provocative background of iridescent ice-dust clouds.", "In the whole spectacle there was a persistent, pervasive hint of stupendous secrecy and potential revelation.", "It was as if these stark, nightmare spires marked the pylons of a frightful gateway into forbidden spheres of dream, and complex gulfs of remote time, space, and ultra-dimensionality.", "I could not help feeling that they were evil things\u2014mountains of madness whose farther slopes looked out over some accursed ultimate abyss.", "That seething, half-luminous cloud background held ineffable suggestions of a vague, ethereal beyondness far more than terrestrially spatial, and gave appalling reminders of the utter remoteness, separateness, desolation, and aeon-long death of this untrodden and unfathomed austral world.", "It was young Danforth who drew our notice to the curious regularities of the higher mountain skyline\u2014regularities like clinging fragments of perfect cubes, which Lake had mentioned in his messages, and which indeed justified his comparison with the dreamlike suggestions of primordial temple ruins, on cloudy Asian mountaintops so subtly and strangely painted by Roerich.", "There was indeed something hauntingly Roerich-like about this whole unearthly continent of mountainous mystery.", "I had felt it in October when we first caught sight of Victoria Land, and I felt it afresh now.", "I felt, too, another wave of uneasy consciousness of Archaean mythical resemblances; of how disturbingly this lethal realm corresponded to the evilly famed plateau of Leng in the primal writings.", "Mythologists have placed Leng in Central Asia; but the racial memory of man\u2014or of his predecessors\u2014is long, and it may well be that certain tales have come down from lands and mountains and temples of horror earlier than Asia and earlier than any human world we know.", "A few daring mystics have hinted at a pre-Pleistocene origin for the fragmentary Pnakotic Manuscripts, and have suggested that the devotees of Tsathoggua were as alien to mankind as Tsathoggua itself.", "Leng, wherever in space or time it might brood, was not a region I would care to be in or near, nor did I relish the proximity of a world that had ever bred such ambiguous and Archaean monstrosities as those Lake had just mentioned.", "At the moment I felt sorry that I had ever read the abhorred Necronomicon, or talked so much with that unpleasantly erudite folklorist Wilmarth at the university.", "This mood undoubtedly served to aggravate my reaction to the bizarre mirage which burst upon us from the increasingly opalescent zenith as we drew near the mountains and began to make out the cumulative undulations of the foothills.", "I had seen dozens of polar mirages during the preceding weeks, some of them quite as uncanny and fantastically vivid as the present sample; but this one had a wholly novel and obscure quality of menacing symbolism, and I shuddered as the seething labyrinth of fabulous walls and towers and minarets loomed out of the troubled ice vapors above our heads.", "The effect was that of a Cyclopean city of no architecture known to man or to human imagination, with vast aggregations of night-black masonry embodying monstrous perversions of geometrical laws.", "There were truncated cones, sometimes terraced or fluted, surmounted by tall cylindrical shafts here and there bulbously enlarged and often capped with tiers of thinnish scalloped disks; and strange beetling, table-like constructions suggesting piles of multitudinous rectangular slabs or circular plates or five-pointed stars with each one overlapping the one beneath.", "There were composite cones and pyramids either alone or surmounting cylinders or cubes or flatter truncated cones and pyramids, and occasional needle-like spires in curious clusters of five.", "All of these febrile structures seemed knit together by tubular bridges crossing from one to the other at various dizzy heights, and the implied scale of the whole was terrifying and oppressive in its sheer gigantism.", "The general type of mirage was not unlike some of the wilder forms observed and drawn by the arctic whaler Scoresby in 1820, but at this time and place, with those dark, unknown mountain peaks soaring stupendously ahead, that anomalous elder-world discovery in our minds, and the pall of probable disaster enveloping the greater part of our expedition, we all seemed to find in it a taint of latent malignity and infinitely evil portent.", "I was glad when the mirage began to break up, though in the process the various nightmare turrets and cones assumed distorted, temporary forms of even vaster hideousness.", "As the whole illusion dissolved to churning opalescence we began to look earthward again, and saw that our journey\u2019s end was not far off.", "The unknown mountains ahead rose dizzily up like a fearsome rampart of giants, their curious regularities showing with startling clearness even without a field-glass.", "We were over the lowest foothills now, and could see amidst the snow, ice, and bare patches of their main plateau a couple of darkish spots which we took to be Lake\u2019s camp and boring.", "The higher foothills shot up between five and six miles away, forming a range almost distinct from the terrifying line of more than Himalayan peaks beyond them.", "At length Ropes\u2014the student who had relieved McTighe at the controls\u2014began to head downward toward the left-hand dark spot whose size marked it as the camp.", "As he did so, McTighe sent out the last uncensored wireless message the world was to receive from our expedition.", "Everyone, of course, has read the brief and unsatisfying bulletins of the rest of our antarctic sojourn.", "Some hours after our landing we sent a guarded report of the tragedy we found, and reluctantly announced the wiping out of the whole Lake party by the frightful wind of the preceding day, or of the night before that.", "Eleven known dead, young Gedney missing.", "People pardoned our hazy lack of details through realization of the shock the sad event must have caused us, and believed us when we explained that the mangling action of the wind had rendered all eleven bodies unsuitable for transportation outside.", "Indeed, I flatter myself that even in the midst of our distress, utter bewilderment, and soul-clutching horror, we scarcely went beyond the truth in any specific instance.", "The tremendous significance lies in what we dared not tell; what I would not tell now but for the need of warning others off from nameless terrors.", "It is a fact that the wind had brought dreadful havoc.", "Whether all could have lived through it, even without the other thing, is gravely open to doubt.", "The storm, with its fury of madly driven ice particles, must have been beyond anything our expedition had encountered before.", "One aeroplane shelter\u2014all, it seems, had been left in a far too flimsy and inadequate state\u2014was nearly pulverized; and the derrick at the distant boring was entirely shaken to pieces.", "The exposed metal of the grounded planes and drilling machinery was bruised into a high polish, and two of the small tents were flattened despite their snow banking.", "Wooden surfaces left out in the blast were pitted and denuded of paint, and all signs of tracks in the snow were completely obliterated.", "It is also true that we found none of the Archaean biological objects in a condition to take outside as a whole.", "We did gather some minerals from a vast, tumbled pile, including several of the greenish soapstone fragments whose odd five-pointed rounding and faint patterns of grouped dots caused so many doubtful comparisons; and some fossil bones, among which were the most typical of the curiously injured specimens.", "None of the dogs survived, their hurriedly built snow inclosure near the camp being almost wholly destroyed.", "The wind may have done that, though the greater breakage on the side next the camp, which was not the windward one, suggests an outward leap or break of the frantic beasts themselves.", "All three sledges were gone, and we have tried to explain that the wind may have blown them off into the unknown.", "The drill and ice-melting machinery at the boring were too badly damaged to warrant salvage, so we used them to choke up that subtly disturbing gateway to the past which Lake had blasted.", "We likewise left at the camp the two most shaken up of the planes; since our surviving party had only four real pilots\u2014Sherman, Danforth, McTighe, and Ropes\u2014in all, with Danforth in a poor nervous shape to navigate.", "We brought back all the books, scientific equipment, and other incidentals we could find, though much was rather unaccountably blown away.", "Spare tents and furs were either missing or badly out of condition.", "It was approximately 4 P.M., after wide plane cruising had forced us to give Gedney up for lost, that we sent our guarded message to the Arkham for relaying; and I think we did well to keep it as calm and noncommittal as we succeeded in doing.", "The most we said about agitation concerned our dogs, whose frantic uneasiness near the biological specimens was to be expected from poor Lake\u2019s accounts.", "We did not mention, I think, their display of the same uneasiness when sniffing around the queer greenish soapstones and certain other objects in the disordered region\u2014objects including scientific instruments, aeroplanes, and machinery, both at the camp and at the boring, whose parts had been loosened, moved, or otherwise tampered with by winds that must have harbored singular curiosity and investigativeness.", "About the fourteen biological specimens, we were pardonably indefinite.", "We said that the only ones we discovered were damaged, but that enough was left of them to prove Lake\u2019s description wholly and impressively accurate.", "It was hard work keeping our personal emotions out of this matter\u2014and we did not mention numbers or say exactly how we had found those which we did find.", "We had by that time agreed not to transmit anything suggesting madness on the part of Lake\u2019s men, and it surely looked like madness to find six imperfect monstrosities carefully buried upright in nine-foot snow graves under five-pointed mounds punched over with groups of dots in patterns exactly those on the queer greenish soapstones dug up from Mesozoic or Tertiary times.", "The eight perfect specimens mentioned by Lake seemed to have been completely blown away.", "We were careful, too, about the public\u2019s general peace of mind; hence Danforth and I said little about that frightful trip over the mountains the next day.", "It was the fact that only a radically lightened plane could possibly cross a range of such height, which mercifully limited that scouting tour to the two of us.", "On our return at one A.M., Danforth was close to hysterics, but kept an admirably stiff upper lip.", "It took no persuasion to make him promise not to show our sketches and the other things we brought away in our pockets, not to say anything more to the others than what we had agreed to relay outside, and to hide our camera films for private development later on; so that part of my present story will be as new to Pabodie, McTighe, Ropes, Sherman, and the rest as it will be to the world in general.", "Indeed, Danforth is closer mouthed than I: for he saw, or thinks he saw, one thing he will not tell even me.", "As all know, our report included a tale of a hard ascent\u2014a confirmation of Lake\u2019s opinion that the great peaks are of Archaean slate and other very primal crumpled strata unchanged since at least middle Comanchian times; a conventional comment on the regularity of the clinging cube and rampart formations; a decision that the cave mouths indicate dissolved calcareous veins; a conjecture that certain slopes and passes would permit of the scaling and crossing of the entire range by seasoned mountaineers; and a remark that the mysterious other side holds a lofty and immense superplateau as ancient and unchanging as the mountains themselves\u2014twenty thousand feet in elevation, with grotesque rock formations protruding through a thin glacial layer and with low gradual foothills between the general plateau surface and the sheer precipices of the highest peaks.", "This body of data is in every respect true so far as it goes, and it completely satisfied the men at the camp.", "We laid our absence of sixteen hours\u2014a longer time than our announced flying, landing, reconnoitering, and rock-collecting program called for\u2014to a long mythical spell of adverse wind conditions, and told truly of our landing on the farther foothills.", "Fortunately our tale sounded realistic and prosaic enough not to tempt any of the others into emulating our flight.", "Had any tried to do that, I would have used every ounce of my persuasion to stop them\u2014and I do not know what Danforth would have done.", "While we were gone, Pabodie, Sherman, Ropes, McTighe, and Williamson had worked like beavers over Lake\u2019s two best planes, fitting them again for use despite the altogether unaccountable juggling of their operative mechanism.", "We decided to load all the planes the next morning and start back for our old base as soon as possible.", "Even though indirect, that was the safest way to work toward McMurdo Sound; for a straight-line flight across the most utterly unknown stretches of the aeon-dead continent would involve many additional hazards.", "Further exploration was hardly feasible in view of our tragic decimation and the ruin of our drilling machinery.", "The doubts and horrors around us\u2014which we did not reveal\u2014made us wish only to escape from this austral world of desolation and brooding madness as swiftly as we could.", "As the public knows, our return to the world was accomplished without further disasters.", "All planes reached the old base on the evening of the next day\u2014January 27th\u2014after a swift non-stop flight; and on the 28th we made McMurdo Sound in two laps, the one pause being very brief, and occasioned by a faulty rudder in the furious wind over the ice shelf after we had cleared the great plateau.", "In five days more, the Arkham and Miskatonic, with all hands and equipment on board, were shaking clear of the thickening field ice and working up Ross Sea with the mocking mountains of Victoria Land looming westward against a troubled antarctic sky and twisting the wind\u2019s wails into a wide-ranged musical piping which chilled my soul to the quick.", "Less than a fortnight later we left the last hint of polar land behind us and thanked heaven that we were clear of a haunted, accursed realm where life and death, space and time, have made black and blasphemous alliances, in the unknown epochs since matter first writhed and swam on the planet\u2019s scarce-cooled crust.", "Since our return we have all constantly worked to discourage antarctic exploration, and have kept certain doubts and guesses to ourselves with splendid unity and faithfulness.", "Even young Danforth, with his nervous breakdown, has not flinched or babbled to his doctors\u2014indeed, as I have said, there is one thing he thinks he alone saw which he will not tell even me, though I think it would help his psychological state if he would consent to do so.", "It might explain and relieve much, though perhaps the thing was no more than the delusive aftermath of an earlier shock.", "That is the impression I gather after those rare, irresponsible moments when he whispers disjointed things to me\u2014things which he repudiates vehemently as soon as he gets a grip on himself again.", "It will be hard work deterring others from the great white south, and some of our efforts may directly harm our cause by drawing inquiring notice.", "We might have known from the first that human curiosity is undying, and that the results we announced would be enough to spur others ahead on the same age-long pursuit of the unknown.", "Lake\u2019s reports of those biological monstrosities had aroused naturalists and paleontologists to the highest pitch, though we were sensible enough not to show the detached parts we had taken from the actual buried specimens, or our photographs of those specimens as they were found.", "We also refrained from showing the more puzzling of the scarred bones and greenish soapstones; while Danforth and I have closely guarded the pictures we took or drew on the superplateau across the range, and the crumpled things we smoothed, studied in terror, and brought away in our pockets.", "But now that Starkweather-Moore party is organizing, and with a thoroughness far beyond anything our outfit attempted.", "If not dissuaded, they will get to the innermost nucleus of the antarctic and melt and bore till they bring up that which we know may end the world.", "So I must break through all reticences at last\u2014even about that ultimate, nameless thing beyond the mountains of madness.", "It is only with vast hesitancy and repugnance that I let my mind go back to Lake\u2019s camp and what we really found there\u2014and to that other thing beyond the mountains of madness.", "I am constantly tempted to shirk the details, and to let hints stand for actual facts and ineluctable deductions.", "I hope I have said enough already to let me glide briefly over the rest; the rest, that is, of the horror at the camp.", "I have told of the wind-ravaged terrain, the damaged shelters, the disarranged machinery, the varied uneasiness of our dogs, the missing sledges and other items, the deaths of men and dogs, the absence of Gedney, and the six insanely buried biological specimens, strangely sound in texture for all their structural injuries, from a world forty million years dead.", "I do not recall whether I mentioned that upon checking up the canine bodies we found one dog missing.", "We did not think much about that till later\u2014indeed, only Danforth and I have thought of it at all.", "The principal things I have been keeping back relate to the bodies, and to certain subtle points which may or may not lend a hideous and incredible kind of rationale to the apparent chaos.", "At the time, I tried to keep the men\u2019s minds off those points; for it was so much simpler\u2014so much more normal\u2014to lay everything to an outbreak of madness on the part of some of Lake\u2019s party.", "From the look of things, that demon mountain wind must have been enough to drive any man mad in the midst of this center of all earthly mystery and desolation.", "The crowning abnormality, of course, was the condition of the bodies\u2014men and dogs alike.", "They had all been in some terrible kind of conflict, and were torn and mangled in fiendish and altogether inexplicable ways.", "Death, so far as we could judge, had in each case come from strangulation or laceration.", "The dogs had evidently started the trouble, for the state of their ill-built corral bore witness to its forcible breakage from within.", "It had been set some distance from the camp because of the hatred of the animals for those hellish Archaean organisms, but the precaution seemed to have been taken in vain.", "When left alone in that monstrous wind, behind flimsy walls of insufficient height, they must have stampeded\u2014whether from the wind itself, or from some subtle, increasing odor emitted by the nightmare specimens, one could not say.", "Those specimens, of course, had been covered with a tent-cloth; yet the low antarctic sun had beat steadily upon that cloth, and Lake had mentioned that solar heat tended to make the strangely sound and tough tissues of the things relax and expand.", "Perhaps the wind had whipped the cloth from over them, and jostled them about in such a way that their more pungent olfactory qualities became manifest despite their unbelievable antiquity.", "But whatever had happened, it was hideous and revolting enough.", "Perhaps I had better put squeamishness aside and tell the worst at last\u2014though with a categorical statement of opinion, based on the first-hand observations and most rigid deductions of both Danforth and myself, that the then missing Gedney was in no way responsible for the loathsome horrors we found.", "I have said that the bodies were frightfully mangled.", "Now I must add that some were incised and subtracted from in the most curious, cold-blooded, and inhuman fashion.", "It was the same with dogs and men.", "All the healthier, fatter bodies, quadrupedal or bipedal, had had their most solid masses of tissue cut out and removed, as by a careful butcher; and around them was a strange sprinkling of salt\u2014taken from the ravaged provision chests on the planes\u2014which conjured up the most horrible associations.", "The thing had occurred in one of the crude aeroplane shelters from which the plane had been dragged out, and subsequent winds had effaced all tracks which could have supplied any plausible theory.", "Scattered bits of clothing, roughly slashed from the human incision subjects, hinted no clues.", "It is useless to bring up the half impression of certain faint snow prints in one shielded corner of the ruined inclosure\u2014because that impression did not concern human prints at all, but was clearly mixed up with all the talk of fossil prints which poor Lake had been giving throughout the preceding weeks.", "One had to be careful of one\u2019s imagination in the lee of those overshadowing mountains of madness.", "As I have indicated, Gedney and one dog turned out to be missing in the end.", "When we came on that terrible shelter we had missed two dogs and two men; but the fairly unharmed dissecting tent, which we entered after investigating the monstrous graves, had something to reveal.", "It was not as Lake had left it, for the covered parts of the primal monstrosity had been removed from the improvised table.", "Indeed, we had already realized that one of the six imperfect and insanely buried things we had found\u2014the one with the trace of a peculiarly hateful odor\u2014must represent the collected sections of the entity which Lake had tried to analyze.", "On and around that laboratory table were strewn other things, and it did not take long for us to guess that those things were the carefully though oddly and inexpertly dissected parts of one man and one dog.", "I shall spare the feelings of survivors by omitting mention of the man\u2019s identity.", "Lake\u2019s anatomical instruments were missing, but there were evidences of their careful cleansing.", "The gasoline stove was also gone, though around it we found a curious litter of matches.", "We buried the human parts beside the other ten men; and the canine parts with the other thirty-five dogs.", "Concerning the bizarre smudges on the laboratory table, and on the jumble of roughly handled illustrated books scattered near it, we were much too bewildered to speculate.", "This formed the worst of the camp horror, but other things were equally perplexing.", "The disappearance of Gedney, the one dog, the eight uninjured biological specimens, the three sledges, and certain instruments, illustrated technical and scientific books, writing materials, electric torches and batteries, food and fuel, heating apparatus, spare tents, fur suits, and the like, was utterly beyond sane conjecture; as were likewise the spatter-fringed ink blots on certain pieces of paper, and the evidences of curious alien fumbling and experimentation around the planes and all other mechanical devices both at the camp and at the boring.", "The dogs seemed to abhor this oddly disordered machinery.", "Then, too, there was the upsetting of the larder, the disappearance of certain staples, and the jarringly comical heap of tin cans pried open in the most unlikely ways and at the most unlikely places.", "The profusion of scattered matches, intact, broken, or spent, formed another minor enigma\u2014as did the two or three tent cloths and fur suits which we found lying about with peculiar and unorthodox slashings conceivably due to clumsy efforts at unimaginable adaptations.", "The maltreatment of the human and canine bodies, and the crazy burial of the damaged Archaean specimens, were all of a piece with this apparent disintegrative madness.", "In view of just such an eventuality as the present one, we carefully photographed all the main evidences of insane disorder at the camp; and shall use the prints to buttress our pleas against the departure of the proposed Starkweather-Moore Expedition.", "Our first act after finding the bodies in the shelter was to photograph and open the row of insane graves with the five-pointed snow mounds.", "We could not help noticing the resemblance of these monstrous mounds, with their clusters of grouped dots, to poor Lake\u2019s descriptions of the strange greenish soapstones; and when we came on some of the soapstones themselves in the great mineral pile, we found the likeness very close indeed.", "The whole general formation, it must be made clear, seemed abominably suggestive of the starfish head of the Archaean entities; and we agreed that the suggestion must have worked potently upon the sensitized minds of Lake\u2019s overwrought party.", "Our own first sight of the actual buried entities formed a horrible moment, and sent the imaginations of Pabodie and myself back to some of the shocking primal myths we had read and heard.", "We all agreed that the mere sight and continued presence of the things must have co\u00f6perated with the oppressive polar solitude and daemon mountain wind in driving Lake\u2019s party mad.", "For madness\u2014centering in Gedney as the only possible surviving agent\u2014was the explanation spontaneously adopted by everybody so far as spoken utterance was concerned; though I will not be so naive as to deny that each of us may have harbored wild guesses which sanity forbade him to formulate completely.", "Sherman, Pabodie, and McTighe made an exhaustive aeroplane cruise over all the surrounding territory in the afternoon, sweeping the horizon with field glasses in quest of Gedney and of the various missing things; but nothing came to light.", "The party reported that the titan barrier range extended endlessly to right and left alike, without any diminution in height or essential structure.", "On some of the peaks, though, the regular cube and rampart formations were bolder and plainer, having doubly fantastic similitudes to Roerich-painted Asian hill ruins.", "The distribution of cryptical cave mouths on the black snow-denuded summits seemed roughly even as far as the range could be traced.", "In spite of all the prevailing horrors, we were left with enough sheer scientific zeal and adventurousness to wonder about the unknown realm beyond those mysterious mountains.", "As our guarded messages stated, we rested at midnight after our day of terror and bafflement\u2014but not without a tentative plan for one or more range-crossing altitude flights in a lightened plane with aerial camera and geologist\u2019s outfit, beginning the following morning.", "It was decided that Danforth and I try it first, and we awaked at 7 A.M. intending an early flight; however, heavy winds\u2014mentioned in our brief, bulletin to the outside world\u2014delayed our start till nearly nine o\u2019clock.", "I have already repeated the noncommittal story we told the men at camp\u2014and relayed outside\u2014after our return sixteen hours later.", "It is now my terrible duty to amplify this account by filling in the merciful blanks with hints of what we really saw in the hidden transmontane world\u2014hints of the revelations which have finally driven Danforth to a nervous collapse.", "I wish he would add a really frank word about the thing which he thinks he alone saw\u2014even though it was probably a nervous delusion\u2014and which was perhaps the last straw that put him where he is; but he is firm against that.", "All I can do is to repeat his later disjointed whispers about what set him shrieking as the plane soared back through the wind-tortured mountain pass after that real and tangible shock which I shared.", "This will form my last word.", "If the plain signs of surviving elder horrors in what I disclose be not enough to keep others from meddling with the inner antarctic\u2014or at least from prying too deeply beneath the surface of that ultimate waste of forbidden secrets and inhuman, aeon-cursed desolation\u2014the responsibility for unnamable and perhaps immeasurable evils will not be mine.", "Danforth and I, studying the notes made by Pabodie in his afternoon flight and checking up with a sextant, had calculated that the lowest available pass in the range lay somewhat to the right of us, within sight of camp, and about twenty-three thousand or twenty-four thousand feet above sea level.", "For this point, then, we first headed in the lightened plane as we embarked on our flight of discovery.", "The camp itself, on foothills which sprang from a high continental plateau, was some twelve thousand feet in altitude; hence the actual height increase necessary was not so vast as it might seem.", "Nevertheless we were acutely conscious of the rarefied air and intense cold as we rose; for, on account of visibility conditions, we had to leave the cabin windows open.", "We were dressed, of course, in our heaviest furs.", "As we drew near the forbidding peaks, dark and sinister above the line of crevasse-riven snow and interstitial glaciers, we noticed more and more the curiously regular formations clinging to the slopes; and thought again of the strange Asian paintings of Nicholas Roerich.", "The ancient and wind-weathered rock strata fully verified all of Lake\u2019s bulletins, and proved that these pinnacles had been towering up in exactly the same way since a surprisingly early time in earth\u2019s history\u2014perhaps over fifty million years.", "How much higher they had once been, it was futile to guess; but everything about this strange region pointed to obscure atmospheric influences unfavorable to change, and calculated to retard the usual climatic processes of rock disintegration.", "But it was the mountainside tangle of regular cubes, ramparts, and cave mouths which fascinated and disturbed us most.", "I studied them with a field glass and took aerial photographs while Danforth drove; and at times I relieved him at the controls\u2014though my aviation knowledge was purely an amateur\u2019s\u2014in order to let him use the binoculars.", "We could easily see that much of the material of the things was a lightish Archaean quartzite, unlike any formation visible over broad areas of the general surface; and that their regularity was extreme and uncanny to an extent which poor Lake had scarcely hinted.", "As he had said, their edges were crumbled and rounded from untold aeons of savage weathering; but their preternatural solidity and tough material had saved them from obliteration.", "Many parts, especially those closest to the slopes, seemed identical in substance with the surrounding rock surface.", "The whole arrangement looked like the ruins of Macchu Picchu in the Andes, or the primal foundation walls of Kish as dug up by the Oxford Field Museum Expedition in 1929; and both Danforth and I obtained that occasional impression of separate Cyclopean blocks which Lake had attributed to his flight-companion Carroll.", "How to account for such things in this place was frankly beyond me, and I felt queerly humbled as a geologist.", "Igneous formations often have strange regularities\u2014like the famous Giants\u2019 Causeway in Ireland\u2014but this stupendous range, despite Lake\u2019s original suspicion of smoking cones, was above all else non-volcanic in evident structure.", "The curious cave mouths, near which the odd formations seemed most abundant, presented another albeit a lesser puzzle because of their regularity of outline.", "They were, as Lake\u2019s bulletin had said, often approximately square or semicircular; as if the natural orifices had been shaped to greater symmetry by some magic hand.", "Their numerousness and wide distribution were remarkable, and suggested that the whole region was honeycombed with tunnels dissolved out of limestone strata.", "Such glimpses as we secured did not extend far within the caverns, but we saw that they were apparently clear of stalactites and stalagmites.", "Outside, those parts of the mountain slopes adjoining the apertures seemed invariably smooth and regular; and Danforth thought that the slight cracks and pittings of the weathering tended toward unusual patterns.", "Filled as he was with the horrors and strangenesses discovered at the camp, he hinted that the pittings vaguely resembled those baffling groups of dots sprinkled over the primeval greenish soapstones, so hideously duplicated on the madly conceived snow mounds above those six buried monstrosities.", "We had risen gradually in flying over the higher foothills and along toward the relatively low pass we had selected.", "As we advanced we occasionally looked down at the snow and ice of the land route, wondering whether we could have attempted the trip with the simpler equipment of earlier days.", "Somewhat to our surprise we saw that the terrain was far from difficult as such things go; and that despite the crevasses and other bad spots it would not have been likely to deter the sledges of a Scott, a Shackleton, or an Amundsen.", "Some of the glaciers appeared to lead up to wind-bared passes with unusual continuity, and upon reaching our chosen pass we found that its case formed no exception.", "Our sensations of tense expectancy as we prepared to round the crest and peer out over an untrodden world can hardly be described on paper; even though we had no cause to think the regions beyond the range essentially different from those already seen and traversed.", "The touch of evil mystery in these barrier mountains, and in the beckoning sea of opalescent sky glimpsed betwixt their summits, was a highly subtle and attenuated matter not to be explained in literal words.", "Rather was it an affair of vague psychological symbolism and aesthetic association\u2014a thing mixed up with exotic poetry and paintings, and with archaic myths lurking in shunned and forbidden volumes.", "Even the wind\u2019s burden held a peculiar strain of conscious malignity; and for a second it seemed that the composite sound included a bizarre musical whistling or piping over a wide range as the blast swept in and out of the omnipresent and resonant cave mouths.", "There was a cloudy note of reminiscent repulsion in this sound, as complex and unplaceable as any of the other dark impressions.", "We were now, after a slow ascent, at a height of twenty-three thousand, five hundred and seventy feet according to the aneroid; and had left the region of clinging snow definitely below us.", "Up here were only dark, bare rock slopes and the start of rough-ribbed glaciers\u2014but with those provocative cubes, ramparts, and echoing cave-mouths to add a portent of the unnatural, the fantastic, and the dreamlike.", "Looking along the line of high peaks, I thought I could see the one mentioned by poor Lake, with a rampart exactly on top.", "It seemed to be half lost in a queer antarctic haze\u2014such a haze, perhaps, as had been responsible for Lake\u2019s early notion of volcanism.", "The pass loomed directly before us, smooth and windswept between its jagged and malignly frowning pylons.", "Beyond it was a sky fretted with swirling vapors and lighted by the low polar sun\u2014the sky of that mysterious farther realm upon which we felt no human eye had ever gazed.", "A few more feet of altitude and we would behold that realm.", "Danforth and I, unable to speak except in shouts amidst the howling, piping wind that raced through the pass and added to the noise of the unmuffled engines, exchanged eloquent glances.", "And then, having gained those last few feet, we did indeed stare across the momentous divide and over the unsampled secrets of an elder and utterly alien earth.", "I think that both of us simultaneously cried out in mixed awe, wonder, terror, and disbelief in our own senses as we finally cleared the pass and saw what lay beyond.", "Of course, we must have had some natural theory in the back of our heads to steady our faculties for the moment.", "Probably we thought of such things as the grotesquely weathered stones of the Garden of the Gods in Colorado, or the fantastically symmetrical wind-carved rocks of the Arizona desert.", "Perhaps we even half thought the sight a mirage like that we had seen the morning before on first approaching those mountains of madness.", "We must have had some such normal notions to fall back upon as our eyes swept that limitless, tempest-scarred plateau and grasped the almost endless labyrinth of colossal, regular, and geometrically eurythmic stone masses which reared their crumbled and pitted crests above a glacial sheet not more than forty or fifty feet deep at its thickest, and in places obviously thinner.", "The effect of the monstrous sight was indescribable, for some fiendish violation of known natural law seemed certain at the outset.", "Here, on a hellishly ancient table-land fully twenty thousand feet high, and in a climate deadly to habitation since a pre-human age not less than five hundred thousand years ago, there stretched nearly to the vision\u2019s limit a tangle of orderly stone which only the desperation of mental self-defense could possibly attribute to any but a conscious and artificial cause.", "We had previously dismissed, so far as serious thought was concerned, any theory that the cubes and ramparts of the mountainsides were other than natural in origin.", "How could they be otherwise, when man himself could scarcely have been differentiated from the great apes at the time when this region succumbed to the present unbroken reign of glacial death?", "Yet now the sway of reason seemed irrefutably shaken, for this Cyclopean maze of squared, curved, and angled blocks had features which cut off all comfortable refuge.", "It was, very clearly, the blasphemous city of the mirage in stark, objective, and ineluctable reality.", "That damnable portent had had a material basis after all\u2014there had been some horizontal stratum of ice dust in the upper air, and this shocking stone survival had projected its image across the mountains according to the simple laws of reflection, Of course, the phantom had been twisted and exaggerated, and had contained things which the real source did not contain; yet now, as we saw that real source, we thought it even more hideous and menacing than its distant image.", "Only the incredible, unhuman massiveness of these vast stone towers and ramparts had saved the frightful things from utter annihilation in the hundreds of thousands\u2014perhaps millions\u2014of years it had brooded there amidst the blasts of a bleak upland.", "\u201cCorona Mundi\u2014Roof of the World\u2014\u201d All sorts of fantastic phrases sprang to our lips as we looked dizzily down at the unbelievable spectacle.", "I thought again of the eldritch primal myths that had so persistently haunted me since my first sight of this dead antarctic world\u2014of the demoniac plateau of Leng, of the Mi-Go, or abominable Snow-Men of the Himalayas, of the Pnakotic Manuscripts with their pre-human implications, of the Cthulhu cult, of the Necronomicon, and of the Hyperborean legends of formless Tsathoggua and the worse than formless star spawn associated with that semi-entity.", "For boundless miles in every direction the thing stretched off with very little thinning; indeed, as our eyes followed it to the right and left along the base of the low, gradual foothills which separated it from the actual mountain rim, we decided that we could see no thinning at all except for an interruption at the left of the pass through which we had come.", "We had merely struck, at random, a limited part of something of incalculable extent.", "The foothills were more sparsely sprinkled with grotesque stone structures, linking the terrible city to the already familiar cubes and ramparts which evidently formed its mountain outposts.", "These latter, as well as the queer cave mouths, were as thick on the inner as on the outer sides of the mountains.", "The nameless stone labyrinth consisted, for the most part, of walls from ten to one hundred and fifty feet in ice-clear height, and of a thickness varying from five to ten feet.", "It was composed mostly of prodigious blocks of dark primordial slate, schist, and sandstone\u2014blocks in many cases as large as 4 \u00d7 6 \u00d7 8 feet\u2014though in several places it seemed to be carved out of a solid, uneven bed-rock of pre-Cambrian slate.", "The buildings were far from equal in size, there being innumerable honeycomb arrangements of enormous extent as well as smaller separate structures.", "The general shape of these things tended to be conical, pyramidal, or terraced; though there were many perfect cylinders, perfect cubes, clusters of cubes, and other rectangular forms, and a peculiar sprinkling of angled edifices whose five-pointed ground plan roughly suggested modern fortifications.", "The builders had made constant and expert use of the principle of the arch, and domes had probably existed in the city\u2019s heyday.", "The whole tangle was monstrously weathered, and the glacial surface from which the towers projected was strewn with fallen blocks and immemorial debris.", "Where the glaciation was transparent we could see the lower parts of the gigantic piles, and we noticed the ice-preserved stone bridges which connected the different towers at varying distances above the ground.", "On the exposed walls we could detect the scarred places where other and higher bridges of the same sort had existed.", "Closer inspection revealed countless largish windows; some of which were closed with shutters of a petrified material originally wood, though most gaped open in a sinister and menacing fashion.", "Many of the ruins, of course, were roofless, and with uneven though wind-rounded upper edges; whilst others, of a more sharply conical or pyramidal model or else protected by higher surrounding structures, preserved intact outlines despite the omnipresent crumbling and pitting.", "With the field glass we could barely make out what seemed to be sculptural decorations in horizontal bands\u2014decorations including those curious groups of dots whose presence on the ancient soapstones now assumed a vastly larger significance.", "In many places the buildings were totally ruined and the ice sheet deeply riven from various geologic causes.", "In other places the stonework was worn down to the very level of the glaciation.", "One broad swath, extending from the plateau\u2019s interior, to a cleft in the foothills about a mile to the left of the pass we had traversed, was wholly free from buildings.", "It probably represented, we concluded, the course of some great river which in Tertiary times\u2014millions of years ago\u2014had poured through the city and into some prodigious subterranean abyss of the great barrier range.", "Certainly, this was above all a region of caves, gulfs, and underground secrets beyond human penetration.", "Looking back to our sensations, and recalling our dazedness at viewing this monstrous survival from aeons we had thought pre-human, I can only wonder that we preserved the semblance of equilibrium, which we did.", "Of course, we knew that something\u2014chronology, scientific theory, or our own consciousness\u2014was woefully awry; yet we kept enough poise to guide the plane, observe many things quite minutely, and take a careful series of photographs which may yet serve both us and the world in good stead.", "In my case, ingrained scientific habit may have helped; for above all my bewilderment and sense of menace, there burned a dominant curiosity to fathom more of this age-old secret\u2014to know what sort of beings had built and lived in this incalculably gigantic place, and what relation to the general world of its time or of other times so unique a concentration of life could have had.", "For this place could be no ordinary city.", "It must have formed the primary nucleus and center of some archaic and unbelievable chapter of earth\u2019s history whose outward ramifications, recalled only dimly in the most obscure and distorted myths, had vanished utterly amidst the chaos of terrene convulsions long before any human race we know had shambled out of apedom.", "Here sprawled a Palaeogaean megalopolis compared with which the fabled Atlantis and Lemuria, Commoriom and Uzuldaroum, and Olatho\u00eb in the land of Lomar, are recent things of today\u2014not even of yesterday; a megalopolis ranking with such whispered pre-human blasphemies as Valusia, R\u2019lyeh, Ib in the land of Mnar, and the Nameless city of Arabia Deserta.", "As we flew above that tangle of stark titan towers my imagination sometimes escaped all bounds and roved aimlessly in realms of fantastic associations\u2014even weaving links betwixt this lost world and some of my own wildest dreams concerning the mad horror at the camp.", "The plane\u2019s fuel tank, in the interest of greater lightness, had been only partly filled; hence we now had to exert caution in our explorations.", "Even so, however, we covered an enormous extent of ground\u2014or, rather, air\u2014after swooping down to a level where the wind became virtually negligible.", "There seemed to be no limit to the mountain range, or to the length of the frightful stone city which bordered its inner foothills.", "Fifty miles of flight in each direction showed no major change in the labyrinth of rock and masonry that clawed up corpse-like through the eternal ice.", "There were, though, some highly absorbing diversifications; such as the carvings on the canyon where that broad river had once pierced the foothills and approached its sinking place in the great range.", "The headlands at the stream\u2019s entrance had been boldly carved into Cyclopean pylons; and something about the ridgy, barrel-shaped designs stirred up oddly vague, hateful, and confusing semi-remembrances in both Danforth and me.", "We also came upon several star-shaped open spaces, evidently public squares, and noted various undulations in the terrain.", "Where a sharp hill rose, it was generally hollowed out into some sort of rambling-stone edifice; but there were at least two exceptions.", "Of these latter, one was too badly weathered to disclose what had been on the jutting eminence, while the other still bore a fantastic conical monument carved out of the solid rock and roughly resembling such things as the well-known Snake Tomb in the ancient valley of Petra.", "Flying inland from the mountains, we discovered that the city was not of infinite width, even though its length along the foothills seemed endless.", "After about thirty miles the grotesque stone buildings began to thin out, and in ten more miles we came to an unbroken waste virtually without signs of sentient artifice.", "The course of the river beyond the city seemed marked by a broad, depressed line, while the land assumed a somewhat greater ruggedness, seeming to slope slightly upward as it receded in the mist-hazed west.", "So far we had made no landing, yet to leave the plateau without an attempt at entering some of the monstrous structures would have been inconceivable.", "Accordingly, we decided to find a smooth place on the foothills near our navigable pass, there grounding the plane and preparing to do some exploration on foot.", "Though these gradual slopes were partly covered with a scattering of ruins, low flying soon disclosed an ample number of possible landing-places.", "Selecting that nearest to the pass, since our flight would be across the great range and back to camp, we succeeded about 12:30 P.M. in effecting a landing on a smooth, hard snow-field wholly devoid of obstacles and well adapted to a swift and favorable take-off later on.", "It did not seem necessary to protect the plane with a snow banking for so brief a time and in so comfortable an absence of high winds at this level; hence we merely saw that the landing skis were safely lodged, and that the vital parts of the mechanism were guarded against the cold.", "For our foot journey we discarded the heaviest of our flying furs, and took with us a small outfit consisting of pocket compass, hand camera, light provisions, voluminous notebooks and paper, geologist\u2019s hammer and chisel, specimen-bags, coil of climbing rope, and powerful electric torches with extra batteries; this equipment having been carried in the plane on the chance that we might be able to effect a landing, take ground pictures, make drawings and topographical sketches, and obtain rock specimens from some bare slope, outcropping, or mountain cave.", "Fortunately we had a supply of extra paper to tear up, place in a spare specimen-bag, and use on the ancient principle of hare-and-hounds for marking our course in any interior mazes we might be able to penetrate.", "This had been brought in case we found some cave system with air quiet enough to allow such a rapid and easy method in place of the usual rock-chipping method of trail-blazing.", "Walking cautiously downhill over the crusted snow toward the stupendous stone labyrinth that loomed against the opalescent west, we felt almost as keen a sense of imminent marvels as we had felt on approaching the unfathomed mountain pass four hours previously.", "True, we had become visually familiar with the incredible secret concealed by the barrier peaks; yet the prospect of actually entering primordial walls reared by conscious beings perhaps millions of years ago\u2014before any known race of men could have existed\u2014was none the less awesome and potentially terrible in its implications of cosmic abnormality.", "Though the thinness of the air at this prodigious altitude made exertion somewhat more difficult than usual, both Danforth and I found ourselves bearing up very well, and felt equal to almost any task which might fall to our lot.", "It took only a few steps to bring us to a shapeless ruin worn level with the snow, while ten or fifteen rods farther on there was a huge, roofless rampart still complete in its gigantic five-pointed outline and rising to an irregular height of ten or eleven feet.", "For this latter we headed; and when at last we were actually able to touch its weathered Cyclopean blocks, we felt that we had established an unprecedented and almost blasphemous link with forgotten aeons normally closed to our species.", "This rampart, shaped like a star and perhaps three hundred feet from point to point, was built of Jurassic sandstone blocks of irregular size, averaging 6 \u00d7 8 feet in surface.", "There was a row of arched loopholes or windows about four feet wide and five feet high, spaced quite symmetrically along the points of the star and at its inner angles, and with the bottoms about four feet from the glaciated surface.", "Looking through these, we could see that the masonry was fully five feet thick, that there were no partitions remaining within, and that there were traces of banded carvings or bas-reliefs on the interior walls\u2014facts we had indeed guessed before, when flying low over this rampart and others like it.", "Though lower parts must have originally existed, all traces of such things were now wholly obscured by the deep layer of ice and snow at this point.", "We crawled through one of the windows and vainly tried to decipher the nearly effaced mural designs, but did not attempt to disturb the glaciated floor.", "Our orientation flights had indicated that many buildings in the city proper were less ice-choked, and that we might perhaps find wholly clear interiors leading down to the true ground level if we entered those structures still roofed at the top.", "Before we left the rampart we photographed it carefully, and studied its mortarless Cyclopean masonry with complete bewilderment.", "We wished that Pabodie were present, for his engineering knowledge might have helped us guess how such titanic blocks could have been handled in that unbelievably remote age when the city and its outskirts were built up.", "The half-mile walk downhill to the actual city, with the upper wind shrieking vainly and savagely through the skyward peaks in the background, was something of which the smallest details will always remain engraved on my mind.", "Only in fantastic nightmares could any human beings but Danforth and me conceive such optical effects.", "Between us and the churning vapors of the west lay that monstrous tangle of dark stone towers, its outr\u00e9 and incredible forms impressing us afresh at every new angle of vision.", "It was a mirage in solid stone, and were it not for the photographs, I would still doubt that such a thing could be.", "The general type of masonry was identical with that of the rampart we had examined; but the extravagant shapes which this masonry took in its urban manifestations were past all description.", "Even the pictures illustrate only one or two phases of its endless variety, preternatural massiveness, and utterly alien exoticism.", "There were geometrical forms for which an Euclid would scarcely find a name\u2014cones of all degrees of irregularity and truncation, terraces of every sort of provocative disproportion, shafts with odd bulbous enlargements, broken columns in curious groups, and five-pointed or five-ridged arrangements of mad grotesqueness.", "As we drew nearer we could see beneath certain transparent parts of the ice-sheet, and detect some of the tubular stone bridges that connected the crazily sprinkled structures at various heights.", "Of orderly streets there seemed to be none, the only broad open swath being a mile to the left, where the ancient river had doubtless flowed through the town into the mountains.", "Our field-glasses showed the external, horizontal bands of nearly effaced sculptures and dot-groups to be very prevalent, and we could half imagine what the city must once have looked like\u2014even though most of the roofs and tower tops had necessarily perished.", "As a whole, it had been a complex tangle of twisted lanes and alleys, all of them deep canyons, and some little better than tunnels because of the overhanging masonry or overarching bridges.", "Now, outspread below us, it loomed like a dream fantasy against a westward mist through whose northern end the low, reddish antarctic sun of early afternoon was struggling to shine; and when, for a moment, that sun encountered a denser obstruction and plunged the scene into temporary shadow, the effect was subtly menacing in a way I can never hope to depict.", "Even the faint howling and piping of the unfelt wind in the great mountain passes behind us took on a wilder note of purposeful malignity.", "The last stage of our descent to the town was unusually steep and abrupt, and a rock outcropping at the edge where the grade changed led us to think that an artificial terrace had once existed there.", "Under the glaciation, we believed, there must be a flight of steps or its equivalent.", "When at last we plunged into the town itself, clambering over fallen masonry and shrinking from the oppressive nearness and dwarfing height of omnipresent crumbling and pitted walls, our sensations again became such that I marvel at the amount of self-control we retained.", "Danforth was frankly jumpy, and began making some offensively irrelevant speculations about the horror at the camp\u2014which I resented all the more because I could not help sharing certain conclusions forced upon us by many features of this morbid survival from nightmare antiquity.", "The speculations worked on his imagination, too; for in one place\u2014where a debris-littered alley turned a sharp corner\u2014he insisted that he saw faint traces of ground markings which he did not like; whilst elsewhere he stopped to listen to a subtle, imaginary sound from some undefined point\u2014a muffled musical piping, he said, not unlike that of the wind in the mountain caves, yet somehow disturbingly different.", "The ceaseless five-pointedness of the surrounding architecture and of the few distinguishable mural arabesques had a dimly sinister suggestiveness we could not escape, and gave us a touch of terrible subconscious certainty concerning the primal entities which had reared and dwelt in this unhallowed place.", "Nevertheless, our scientific and adventurous souls were not wholly dead, and we mechanically carried out our program of chipping specimens from all the different rock types represented in the masonry.", "We wished a rather full set in order to draw better conclusions regarding the age of the place.", "Nothing in the great outer walls seemed to date from later than the Jurassic and Comanchian periods, nor was any piece of stone in the entire place of a greater recency than the Pliocene Age.", "In stark certainty, we were wandering amidst a death which had reigned at least five hundred thousand years, and in all probability even longer.", "As we proceeded through this maze of stone-shadowed twilight we stopped at all available apertures to study interiors and investigate entrance possibilities.", "Some were above our reach, whilst others led only into ice-choked ruins as unroofed and barren as the rampart on the hill.", "One, though spacious and inviting, opened on a seemingly bottomless abyss without visible means of descent.", "Now and then we had a chance to study the petrified wood of a surviving shutter, and were impressed by the fabulous antiquity implied in the still discernible grain.", "These things had come from Mesozoic gymnosperms and conifers\u2014especially Cretaceous cycads\u2014and from fan palms and early angiosperms of plainly Tertiary date.", "Nothing definitely later than the Pliocene could be discovered.", "In the placing of these shutters\u2014whose edges showed the former presence of queer and long-vanished hinges\u2014usage seemed to be varied\u2014some being on the outer and some on the inner side of the deep embrasures.", "They seemed to have become wedged in place, thus surviving the rusting of their former and probably metallic fixtures and fastenings.", "After a time we came across a row of windows\u2014in the bulges of a colossal five-edged cone of undamaged apex\u2014which led into a vast, well-preserved room with stone flooring; but these were too high in the room to permit descent without a rope.", "We had a rope with us, but did not wish to bother with this twenty-foot drop unless obliged to\u2014especially in this thin plateau air where great demands were made upon the heart action.", "This enormous room was probably a hall or concourse of some sort, and our electric torches showed bold, distinct, and potentially startling sculptures arranged round the walls in broad, horizontal bands separated by equally broad strips of conventional arabesques.", "We took careful note of this spot, planning to enter here unless a more easily gained interior were encountered.", "Finally, though, we did encounter exactly the opening we wished; an archway about six feet wide and ten feet high, marking the former end of an aerial bridge which had spanned an alley about five feet above the present level of glaciation.", "These archways, of course, were flush with upper-story floors, and in this case one of the floors still existed.", "The building thus accessible was a series of rectangular terraces on our left facing westward.", "That across the alley, where the other archway yawned, was a decrepit cylinder with no windows and with a curious bulge about ten feet above the aperture.", "It was totally dark inside, and the archway seemed to open on a well of illimitable emptiness.", "Heaped debris made the entrance to the vast left-hand building doubly easy, yet for a moment we hesitated before taking advantage of the long-wished chance.", "For though we had penetrated into this tangle of archaic mystery, it required fresh resolution to carry us actually inside a complete and surviving building of a fabulous elder world whose nature was becoming more and more hideously plain to us.", "In the end, however, we made the plunge, and scrambled up over the rubble into the gaping embrasure.", "The floor beyond was of great slate slabs, and seemed to form the outlet of a long, high corridor with sculptured walls.", "Observing the many inner archways which led off from it, and realizing the probable complexity of the nest of apartments within, we decided that we must begin our system of hare-and-hound trail-blazing.", "Hitherto our compasses, together with frequent glimpses of the vast mountain range between the towers in our rear, had been enough to prevent our losing our way; but from now on, the artificial substitute would be necessary.", "Accordingly we reduced our extra paper to shreds of suitable size, placed these in a bag to be carried by Danforth, and prepared to use them as economically as safety would allow.", "This method would probably gain us immunity from straying, since there did not appear to be any strong air currents inside the primordial masonry.", "If such should develop, or if our paper supply should give out, we could of course fall back on the more secure though more tedious and retarding method of rock-chipping.", "Just how extensive a territory we had opened up, it was impossible to guess without a trial.", "The close and frequent connection of the different buildings made it likely that we might cross from one to another on bridges underneath the ice, except where impeded by local collapses and geologic rifts, for very little glaciation seemed to have entered the massive constructions.", "Almost all the areas of transparent ice had revealed the submerged windows as tightly shuttered, as if the town had been left in that uniform state until the glacial sheet came to crystallize the lower part for all succeeding time.", "Indeed, one gained a curious impression that this place had been deliberately closed and deserted in some dim, bygone aeon, rather than overwhelmed by any sudden calamity or even gradual decay.", "Had the coming of the ice been foreseen, and had a nameless population left en masse to seek a less doomed abode?", "The precise physiographic conditions attending the formation of the ice-sheet at this point would have to wait for later solution.", "It had not, very plainly, been a grinding drive.", "Perhaps the pressure of accumulated snows had been responsible, and perhaps some flood from the river, or from the bursting of some ancient glacial dam in the great range, had helped to create the special state now observable.", "Imagination could conceive almost anything in connection with this place.", "It would be cumbrous to give a detailed, consecutive account of our wanderings inside that cavernous, aeon-dead honeycomb of primal masonry\u2014that monstrous lair of elder secrets which now echoed for the first time, after uncounted epochs, to the tread of human feet.", "This is especially true because so much of the horrible drama and revelation came from a mere study of the omnipresent mural carvings.", "Our flashlight photographs of those carvings will do much toward proving the truth of what we are now disclosing, and it is lamentable that we had not a larger film supply with us.", "As it was, we made crude notebook sketches of certain salient features after all our films were used up.", "The building which we had entered was one of great size and elaborateness, and gave us an impressive notion of the architecture of that nameless geologic past.", "The inner partitions were less massive than the outer walls, but on the lower levels were excellently preserved.", "Labyrinthine complexity, involving curiously irregular differences in floor levels, characterized the entire arrangement; and we should certainly have been lost at the very outset but for the trail of torn paper left behind us.", "We decided to explore the more decrepit upper parts first of all, hence climbed aloft in the maze for a distance of some one hundred feet, to where the topmost tier of chambers yawned snowily and ruinously open to the polar sky.", "Ascent was effected over the steep, transversely ribbed stone ramps or inclined planes which everywhere served in lieu of stairs.", "The rooms we encountered were of all imaginable shapes and proportions, ranging from five-pointed stars to triangles and perfect cubes.", "It might be safe to say that their general average was about 30 \u00d7 30 feet in floor area, and 20 feet in height, though many larger apartments existed.", "After thoroughly examining the upper regions and the glacial level, we descended, story by story, into the submerged part, where indeed we soon saw we were in a continuous maze of connected chambers and passages probably leading over unlimited areas outside this particular building.", "The Cyclopean massiveness and gigantism of everything about us became curiously oppressive; and there was something vaguely but deeply unhuman in all the contours, dimensions, proportions, decorations, and constructional nuances of the blasphemously archaic stonework.", "We soon realized, from what the carvings revealed, that this monstrous city was many million years old.", "We cannot yet explain the engineering principles used in the anomalous balancing and adjustment of the vast rock masses, though the function of the arch was clearly much relied on.", "The rooms we visited were wholly bare of all portable contents, a circumstance which sustained our belief in the city\u2019s deliberate desertion.", "The prime decorative feature was the almost universal system of mural sculpture, which tended to run in continuous horizontal bands three feet wide and arranged from floor to ceiling in alternation with bands of equal width given over to geometrical arabesques.", "There were exceptions to this rule of arrangement, but its preponderance was overwhelming.", "Often, however, a series of smooth cartouches containing oddly patterned groups of dots would be sunk along one of the arabesque bands.", "The technique, we soon saw, was mature, accomplished, and aesthetically evolved to the highest degree of civilized mastery, though utterly alien in every detail to any known art tradition of the human race.", "In delicacy of execution no sculpture I have ever seen could approach it.", "The minutest details of elaborate vegetation, or of animal life, were rendered with astonishing vividness despite the bold scale of the carvings; whilst the conventional designs were marvels of skillful intricacy.", "The arabesques displayed a profound use of mathematical principles, and were made up of obscurely symmetrical curves and angles based on the quantity of five.", "The pictorial bands followed a highly formalized tradition, and involved a peculiar treatment of perspective, but had an artistic force that moved us profoundly, notwithstanding the intervening gulf of vast geologic periods.", "Their method of design hinged on a singular juxtaposition of the cross-section with the two-dimensional silhouette, and embodied an analytical psychology beyond that of any known race of antiquity.", "It is useless to try to compare this art with any represented in our museums.", "Those who see our photographs will probably find its closest analogue in certain grotesque conceptions of the most daring futurists.", "The arabesque tracery consisted altogether of depressed lines, whose depth on unweathered walls varied from one to two inches.", "When cartouches with dot-groups appeared\u2014evidently as inscriptions in some unknown and primordial language and alphabet\u2014the depression of the smooth surface was perhaps an inch and a half, and of the dots perhaps a half inch more.", "The pictorial bands were in countersunk low relief, their background being depressed about two inches from the original wall surface.", "In some specimens marks of a former coloration could be detected, though for the most part the untold aeons had disintegrated and banished any pigments which may have been applied.", "The more one studied the marvelous technique, the more one admired the things.", "Beneath their strict conventionalization one could grasp the minute and accurate observation and graphic skill of the artists; and indeed, the very conventions themselves served to symbolize and accentuate the real essence or vital differentiation of every object delineated.", "We felt, too, that besides these recognizable excellences there were others lurking beyond the reach of our perceptions.", "Certain touches here and there gave vague hints of latent symbols and stimuli which another mental and emotional background, and a fuller or different sensory equipment, might have made of profound and poignant significance to us.", "The subject matter of the sculptures obviously came from the life of the vanished epoch of their creation, and contained a large proportion of evident history.", "It is this abnormal historic-mindedness of the primal race\u2014a chance circumstance operating, through coincidence, miraculously in our favor\u2014which made the carvings so awesomely informative to us, and which caused us to place their photography and transcription above all other considerations.", "In certain rooms the dominant arrangement was varied by the presence of maps, astronomical charts, and other scientific designs of an enlarged scale\u2014these things giving a naive and terrible corroboration to what we gathered from the pictorial friezes and dadoes.", "In hinting at what the whole revealed, I can only hope that my account will not arouse a curiosity greater than sane caution on the part of those who believe me at all.", "It would be tragic if any were to be allured to that realm of death and horror by the very warning meant to discourage them.", "Interrupting these sculptured walls were high windows and massive twelve-foot doorways; both now and then retaining the petrified wooden planks\u2014elaborately carved and polished\u2014of the actual shutters and doors.", "All metal fixtures had long ago vanished, but some of the doors remained in place and had to be forced aside as we progressed from room to room.", "Window-frames with odd transparent panes\u2014mostly elliptical\u2014survived here and there, though in no considerable quantity.", "There were also frequent niches of great magnitude, generally empty, but once in a while containing some bizarre object carved from green soapstone which was either broken or perhaps held too inferior to warrant removal.", "Other apertures were undoubtedly connected with bygone mechanical facilities\u2014heating, lighting, and the like\u2014of a sort suggested in many of the carvings.", "Ceilings tended to be plain, but had sometimes been inlaid with green soapstone or other tiles, mostly fallen now.", "Floors were also paved with such tiles, though plain stonework predominated.", "As I have said, all furniture and other movables were absent; but the sculptures gave a clear idea of the strange devices which had once filled these tomb-like, echoing rooms.", "Above the glacial sheet the floors were generally thick with detritus, litter, and debris, but farther down this condition decreased.", "In some of the lower chambers and corridors there was little more than gritty dust or ancient incrustations, while occasional areas had an uncanny air of newly swept immaculateness.", "Of course, where rifts or collapses had occurred, the lower levels were as littered as the upper ones.", "A central court\u2014as in other structures we had seen from the air\u2014saved the inner regions from total darkness; so that we seldom had to use our electric torches in the upper rooms except when studying sculptured details.", "Below the ice cap, however, the twilight deepened; and in many parts of the tangled ground level there was an approach to absolute blackness.", "To form even a rudimentary idea of our thoughts and feelings as we penetrated this aeon-silent maze of unhuman masonry, one must correlate a hopelessly bewildering chaos of fugitive moods, memories, and impressions.", "The sheer appalling antiquity and lethal desolation of the place were enough to overwhelm almost any sensitive person, but added to these elements were the recent unexplained horror at the camp, and the revelations all too soon effected by the terrible mural sculptures around us.", "The moment we came upon a perfect section of carving, where no ambiguity of interpretation could exist, it took only a brief study to give us the hideous truth\u2014a truth which it would be naive to claim Danforth and I had not independently suspected before, though we had carefully refrained from even hinting it to each other.", "There could now be no further merciful doubt about the nature of the beings which had built and inhabited this monstrous dead city millions of years ago, when man\u2019s ancestors were primitive archaic mammals, and vast dinosaurs roamed the tropical steppes of Europe and Asia.", "We had previously clung to a desperate alternative and insisted\u2014each to himself\u2014that the omnipresence of the five-pointed motifs meant only some cultural or religious exaltation of the Archaean natural object which had so patently embodied the quality of five-pointedness; as the decorative motifs of Minoan Crete exalted the sacred bull, those of Egypt the scarabaeus, those of Rome the wolf and the eagle, and those of various savage tribes some chosen totem animal.", "But this lone refuge was now stripped from us, and we were forced to face definitely the reason-shaking realization which the reader of these pages has doubtless long ago anticipated.", "I can scarcely bear to write it down in black and white even now, but perhaps that will not be necessary.", "The things once rearing and dwelling in this frightful masonry in the age of dinosaurs were not indeed dinosaurs, but far worse.", "Mere dinosaurs were new and almost brainless objects\u2014but the builders of the city were wise and old, and had left certain traces in rocks even then laid down well nigh a thousand million years\u2014rocks laid down before the true life of earth had advanced beyond plastic groups of cells\u2014rocks laid down before the true life of earth had existed at all.", "They were the makers and enslavers of that life, and above all doubt the originals of the fiendish elder myths which things like the Pnakotic Manuscripts and the Necronomicon affrightedly hint about.", "They were the great \u201cOld Ones\u201d that had filtered down from the stars when earth was young\u2014the beings whose substance an alien evolution had shaped, and whose powers were such as this planet had never bred.", "And to think that only the day before Danforth and I had actually looked upon fragments of their millennially fossilized substance\u2014and that poor Lake and his party had seen their complete outlines.", ".", ".", ".", "It is of course impossible for me to relate in proper order the stages by which we picked up what we know of that monstrous chapter of pre-human life.", "After the first shock of the certain revelation, we had to pause a while to recuperate, and it was fully three o\u2019clock before we got started on our actual tour of systematic research.", "The sculptures in the building we entered were of relatively late date\u2014perhaps two million years ago\u2014as checked up by geological, biological, and astronomical features\u2014and embodied an art which would be called decadent in comparison with that of specimens we found in older buildings after crossing bridges under the glacial sheet.", "One edifice hewn from the solid rock seemed to go back forty or possibly even fifty million years\u2014to the lower Eocene or upper Cretaceous\u2014and contained bas-reliefs of an artistry surpassing anything else, with one tremendous exception, that we encountered.", "That was, we have since agreed, the oldest domestic structure we traversed.", "Were it not for the support of those photographs soon to be made public, I would refrain from telling what I found and inferred, lest I be confined as a madman.", "Of course, the infinitely early parts of the patchwork tale\u2014representing the pre-terrestrial life of the star-headed beings on other planets, in other galaxies, and in other universes\u2014can readily be interpreted as the fantastic mythology of those beings themselves; yet such parts sometimes involved designs and diagrams so uncannily close to the latest findings of mathematics and astrophysics that I scarcely know what to think.", "Let others judge when they see the photographs I shall publish.", "Naturally, no one set of carvings which we encountered told more than a fraction of any connected story, nor did we even begin to come upon the various stages of that story in their proper order.", "Some of the vast rooms were independent units so far as their designs were concerned, whilst in other cases a continuous chronicle would be carried through a series of rooms and corridors.", "The best of the maps and diagrams were on the walls of a frightful abyss below even the ancient ground level\u2014a cavern perhaps two hundred feet square and sixty feet high, which had almost undoubtedly been an educational center of some sort.", "There were many provoking repetitions of the same material in different rooms and buildings, since certain chapters of experience, and certain summaries or phases of racial history, had evidently been favorites with different decorators or dwellers.", "Sometimes, though, variant versions of the same theme proved useful in settling debatable points and filling up gaps.", "I still wonder that we deduced so much in the short time at our disposal.", "Of course, we even now have only the barest outline\u2014and much of that was obtained later on from a study of the photographs and sketches we made.", "It may be the effect of this later study\u2014the revived memories and vague impressions acting in conjunction with his general sensitiveness and with that final supposed horror-glimpse whose essence he will not reveal even to me\u2014which has been the immediate source of Danforth\u2019s present breakdown.", "But it had to be; for we could not issue our warning intelligently without the fullest possible information, and the issuance of that warning is a prime necessity.", "Certain lingering influences in that unknown antarctic world of disordered time and alien natural law make it imperative that further exploration be discouraged.", "The full story, so far as deciphered, will eventually appear in an official bulletin of Miskatonic University.", "Here I shall sketch only the salient highlights in a formless, rambling way.", "Myth or otherwise, the sculptures told of the coming of those star-headed things to the nascent, lifeless earth out of cosmic space\u2014their coming, and the coming of many other alien entities such as at certain times embark upon spatial pioneering.", "They seemed able to traverse the interstellar ether on their vast membranous wings\u2014thus oddly confirming some curious hill folklore long ago told me by an antiquarian colleague.", "They had lived under the sea a good deal, building fantastic cities and fighting terrific battles with nameless adversaries by means of intricate devices employing unknown principles of energy.", "Evidently their scientific and mechanical knowledge far surpassed man\u2019s today, though they made use of its more widespread and elaborate forms only when obliged to.", "Some of the sculptures suggested that they had passed through a stage of mechanized life on other planets, but had receded upon finding its effects emotionally unsatisfying.", "Their preternatural toughness of organization and simplicity of natural wants made them peculiarly able to live on a high plane without the more specialized fruits of artificial manufacture, and even without garments, except for occasional protection against the elements.", "It was under the sea, at first for food and later for other purposes, that they first created earth-life\u2014using available substances according to long-known methods.", "The more elaborate experiments came after the annihilation of various cosmic enemies.", "They had done the same thing on other planets, having manufactured not only necessary foods, but certain multicellular protoplasmic masses capable of molding their tissues into all sorts of temporary organs under hypnotic influence and thereby forming ideal slaves to perform the heavy work of the community.", "These viscous masses were without doubt what Abdul Alhazred whispered about as the \u201cShoggoths\u201d in his frightful Necronomicon, though even that mad Arab had not hinted that any existed on earth except in the dreams of those who had chewed a certain alkaloidal herb.", "When the star-headed Old Ones on this planet had synthesized their simple food forms and bred a good supply of Shoggoths, they allowed other cell-groups to develop into other forms of animal and vegetable life for sundry purposes, extirpating any whose presence became troublesome.", "With the aid of the Shoggoths, whose expansions could be made to lift prodigious weights, the small, low cities under the sea grew to vast and imposing labyrinths of stone not unlike those which later rose on land.", "Indeed, the highly adaptable Old Ones had lived much on land in other parts of the universe, and probably retained many traditions of land construction.", "As we studied the architecture of all these sculptured palaeogean cities, including that whose aeon-dead corridors we were even then traversing, we were impressed by a curious coincidence which we have not yet tried to explain, even to ourselves.", "The tops of the buildings, which in the actual city around us had, of course, been weathered into shapeless ruins ages ago, were clearly displayed in the bas-reliefs, and showed vast clusters of needle-like spires, delicate finials on certain cone and pyramid apexes, and tiers of thin, horizontal scalloped disks capping cylindrical shafts.", "This was exactly what we had seen in that monstrous and portentous mirage, cast by a dead city whence such skyline features had been absent for thousands and tens of thousands of years, which loomed on our ignorant eyes across the unfathomed mountains of madness as we first approached poor Lake\u2019s ill-fated camp.", "Of the life of the Old Ones, both under the sea and after part of them migrated to land, volumes could be written.", "Those in shallow water had continued the fullest use of the eyes at the ends of their five main head tentacles, and had practiced the arts of sculpture and of writing in quite the usual way\u2014the writing accomplished with a stylus on waterproof waxen surfaces.", "Those lower down in the ocean depths, though they used a curious phosphorescent organism to furnish light, pieced out their vision with obscure special senses operating through the prismatic cilia on their heads\u2014senses which rendered all the Old Ones partly independent of light in emergencies.", "Their forms of sculpture and writing had changed curiously during the descent, embodying certain apparently chemical coating processes\u2014probably to secure phosphorescence\u2014which the bas-reliefs could not make clear to us.", "The beings moved in the sea partly by swimming\u2014using the lateral crinoid arms\u2014and partly by wriggling with the lower tier of tentacles containing the pseudo-feet.", "Occasionally they accomplished long swoops with the auxiliary use of two or more sets of their fan-like folding wings.", "On land they locally used the pseudofeet, but now and then flew to great heights or over long distances with their wings.", "The many slender tentacles into which the crinoid arms branched were infinitely delicate, flexible, strong, and accurate in muscular-nervous coordination\u2014ensuring the utmost skill and dexterity in all artistic and other manual operations.", "The toughness of the things was almost incredible.", "Even the terrific pressure of the deepest sea-bottoms appeared powerless to harm them.", "Very few seemed to die at all except by violence, and their burial-places were very limited.", "The fact that they covered their vertically inhumed dead with five-pointed inscribed mounds set up thoughts in Danforth and me which made a fresh pause and recuperation necessary after the sculptures revealed it.", "The beings multiplied by means of spores\u2014like vegetable pteridophytes, as Lake had suspected\u2014but, owing to their prodigious toughness and longevity, and consequent lack of replacement needs, they did not encourage the large-scale development of new prothallia except when they had new regions to colonize.", "The young matured swiftly, and received an education evidently beyond any standard we can imagine.", "The prevailing intellectual and aesthetic life was highly evolved, and produced a tenaciously enduring set of customs and institutions which I shall describe more fully in my coming monograph.", "These varied slightly according to sea or land residence, but had the same foundations and essentials.", "Though able, like vegetables, to derive nourishment from inorganic substances, they vastly preferred organic and especially animal food.", "They ate uncooked marine life under the sea, but cooked their viands on land.", "They hunted game and raised meat herds\u2014slaughtering with sharp weapons whose odd marks on certain fossil bones our expedition had noted.", "They resisted all ordinary temperatures marvelously, and in their natural state could live in water down to freezing.", "When the great chill of the Pleistocene drew on, however\u2014nearly a million years ago\u2014the land dwellers had to resort to special measures, including artificial heating\u2014until at last the deadly cold appears to have driven them back into the sea.", "For their prehistoric flights through cosmic space, legend said, they absorbed certain chemicals and became almost independent of eating, breathing, or heat conditions\u2014but by the time of the great cold they had lost track of the method.", "In any case they could not have prolonged the artificial state indefinitely without harm.", "Being non-pairing and semi-vegetable in structure, the Old Ones had no biological basis for the family phase of mammal life, but seemed to organize large households on the principles of comfortable space-utility and\u2014as we deduced from the pictured occupations and diversions of co-dwellers\u2014congenial mental association.", "In furnishing their homes they kept everything in the center of the huge rooms, leaving all the wall spaces free for decorative treatment.", "Lighting, in the case of the land inhabitants, was accomplished by a device probably electro-chemical in nature.", "Both on land and under water they used curious tables, chairs and couches like cylindrical frames\u2014for they rested and slept upright with folded-down tentacles\u2014and racks for hinged sets of dotted surfaces forming their books.", "Government was evidently complex and probably socialistic, though no certainties in this regard could be deduced from the sculptures we saw.", "There was extensive commerce, both local and between different cities\u2014certain small, flat counters, five-pointed and inscribed, serving as money.", "Probably the smaller of the various greenish soapstones found by our expedition were pieces of such currency.", "Though the culture was mainly urban, some agriculture and much stock raising existed.", "Mining and a limited amount of manufacturing were also practiced.", "Travel was very frequent, but permanent migration seemed relatively rare except for the vast colonizing movements by which the race expanded.", "For personal locomotion no external aid was used, since in land, air, and water movement alike the Old Ones seemed to possess excessively vast capacities for speed.", "Loads, however, were drawn by beasts of burden\u2014Shoggoths under the sea, and a curious variety of primitive vertebrates in the later years of land existence.", "These vertebrates, as well as an infinity of other life forms\u2014animal and vegetable, marine, terrestrial, and aerial\u2014were the products of unguided evolution acting on life cells made by the Old Ones, but escaping beyond their radius of attention.", "They had been suffered to develop unchecked because they had not come in conflict with the dominant beings.", "Bothersome forms, of course, were mechanically exterminated.", "It interested us to see in some of the very last and most decadent sculptures a shambling, primitive mammal, used sometimes for food and sometimes as an amusing buffoon by the land dwellers, whose vaguely simian and human foreshadowings were unmistakable.", "In the building of land cities the huge stone blocks of the high towers were generally lifted by vast-winged pterodactyls of a species heretofore unknown to paleontology.", "The persistence with which the Old Ones survived various geologic changes and convulsions of the earth\u2019s crust was little short of miraculous.", "Though few or none of their first cities seem to have remained beyond the Archaean Age, there was no interruption in their civilization or in the transmission of their records.", "Their original place of advent to the planet was the Antarctic Ocean, and it is likely that they came not long after the matter forming the moon was wrenched from the neighboring South Pacific.", "According to one of the sculptured maps the whole globe was then under water, with stone cities scattered farther and farther from the antarctic as aeons passed.", "Another map shows a vast bulk of dry land around the south pole, where it is evident that some of the beings made experimental settlements, though their main centers were transferred to the nearest sea bottom.", "Later maps, which display the land mass as cracking and drifting, and sending certain detached parts northward, uphold in a striking way the theories of continental drift lately advanced by Taylor, Wegener, and Joly.", "With the upheaval of new land in the South Pacific tremendous events began.", "Some of the marine cities were hopelessly shattered, yet that was not the worst misfortune.", "Another race\u2014a land race of beings shaped like octopi and probably corresponding to fabulous pre-human spawn of Cthulhu\u2014soon began filtering down from cosmic infinity and precipitated a -monstrous war which for a time drove the Old Ones wholly back to the sea\u2014a colossal blow in view of the increasing land settlements.", "Later peace was made, and the new lands were given to the Cthulhu spawn whilst the Old Ones held the sea and the older lands.", "New land cities were founded\u2014the greatest of them in the antarctic, for this region of first arrival was sacred.", "From then on, as before, the antarctic remained the center of the Old Ones\u2019 civilization, and all the cities built there by the Cthulhu spawn were blotted out.", "Then suddenly the lands of the Pacific sank again, taking with them the frightful stone city of R\u2019lyeh and all the cosmic octopi, so that the Old Ones were again supreme on the planet except for one shadowy fear about which they did not like to speak.", "At a rather later age their cities dotted all the land and water areas of the globe\u2014hence the recommendation in my coming monograph that some archaeologist make systematic borings with Pabodie\u2019s type of apparatus in certain widely separated regions.", "The steady trend down the ages was from water to land\u2014a movement encouraged by the rise of new land masses, though the ocean was never wholly deserted.", "Another cause of the landward movement was the new difficulty in breeding and managing the Shoggoths upon which successful sea life depended.", "With the march of time, as the sculptures sadly confessed, the art of creating new life from inorganic matter had been lost, so that the Old Ones had to depend on the molding of forms already in existence.", "On land the great reptiles proved highly tractable; but the Shoggoths of the sea, reproducing by fission and acquiring a dangerous degree of accidental intelligence, presented for a time a formidable problem.", "They had always been controlled through the hypnotic suggestions of the Old Ones, and had modeled their tough plasticity into various useful temporary limbs and organs; but now their self-modeling powers were sometimes exercised independently, and in various imitative forms implanted by past suggestion.", "They had, it seems, developed a semi-stable brain whose separate and occasionally stubborn volition echoed the will of the Old Ones without always obeying it.", "Sculptured images of these Shoggoths filled Danforth and me with horror and loathing.", "They were normally shapeless entities composed of a viscous jelly which looked like an agglutination of bubbles, and each averaged about fifteen feet in diameter when a sphere.", "They had, however, a constantly shifting shape and volume\u2014throwing out temporary developments or forming apparent organs of sight, hearing, and speech in imitation of their masters, either spontaneously or according to suggestion.", "They seem to have become peculiarly intractable toward the middle of the Permian Age, perhaps one hundred and fifty million years ago, when a veritable war of re-subjugation was waged upon them by the marine Old Ones.", "Pictures of this war, and of the headless, slime-coated fashion in which the Shoggoths typically left their slain victims, held a marvelously fearsome quality despite the intervening abyss of untold ages.", "The Old Ones had used curious weapons of molecular and atomic disturbances against the rebel entities, and in the end had achieved a complete victory.", "Thereafter the sculptures showed a period in which Shoggoths were tamed and broken by armed Old Ones as the wild horses of the American west were tamed by cowboys.", "Though during the rebellion the Shoggoths had shown an ability to live out of water, this transition was not encouraged\u2014since their usefulness on land would hardly have been commensurate with the trouble of their management.", "During the Jurassic Age the Old Ones met fresh adversity in the form of a new invasion from outer space\u2014this time by half-fungous, half-crustacean creatures\u2014creatures undoubtedly the same as those figuring in certain whispered hill legends of the north, and remembered in the Himalayas as the Mi-Go, or abominable Snow-Men.", "To fight these beings the Old Ones attempted, for the first time since their terrene advent, to sally forth again into the planetary ether; but, despite all traditional preparations, found it no longer possible to leave the earth\u2019s atmosphere.", "Whatever the old secret of interstellar travel had been, it was now definitely lost to the race.", "In the end the Mi-Go drove the Old Ones out of all the northern lands, though they were powerless to disturb those in the sea.", "Little by little the slow retreat of the elder race to their original antarctic habitat was beginning.", "It was curious to note from the pictured battles that both the Cthulhu spawn and the Mi-Go seem to have been composed of matter more widely different from that which we know than was the substance of the Old Ones.", "They were able to undergo transformations and reintegrations impossible for their adversaries, and seem therefore to have originally come from even remoter gulfs of the cosmic space.", "The Old Ones, but for their abnormal toughness and peculiar vital properties, were strictly material, and must have had their absolute origin within the known space-time continuum\u2014whereas the first sources of the other beings can only be guessed at with bated breath.", "All this, of course, assuming that the non-terrestrial linkages and the anomalies ascribed to the invading foes are not pure mythology.", "Conceivably, the Old Ones might have invented a cosmic framework to account for their occasional defeats, since historical interest and pride obviously formed their chief psychological element.", "It is significant that their annals failed to mention many advanced and potent races of beings whose mighty cultures and towering cities figure persistently in certain obscure legends.", "The changing state of the world through long geologic ages appeared with startling vividness in many of the sculptured maps and scenes.", "In certain cases existing science will require revision, while in other cases its bold deductions are magnificently confirmed.", "As I have said, the hypothesis of Taylor, Wegener, and Joly that all the continents are fragments of an original antarctic land mass which cracked from centrifugal force and drifted apart over a technically viscous lower surface\u2014an hypothesis suggested by such things as the complementary outlines of Africa and South America, and the way the great mountain chains are rolled and shoved up\u2014receives striking support from this uncanny source.", "Maps evidently showing the Carboniferous world of an hundred million or more years ago displayed significant rifts and chasms destined later to separate Africa from the once continuous realms of Europe (then the Valusia of primal legend), Asia, the Americas, and the antarctic continent.", "Other charts\u2014and most significantly one in connection with the founding fifty million years ago of the vast dead city around us\u2014showed all the present continents well differentiated.", "And in the latest discoverable specimen\u2014dating perhaps from the Pliocene Age\u2014the approximate world of today appeared quite clearly despite the linkage of Alaska with Siberia, of North America with Europe through Greenland, and of South America with the antarctic continent through Graham Land.", "In the Carboniferous map the whole globe\u2014ocean floor and rifted land mass alike\u2014bore symbols of the Old Ones\u2019 vast stone cities, but in the later charts the gradual recession toward the antarctic became very plain.", "The final Pliocene specimen showed no land cities except on the antarctic continent and the tip of South America, nor any ocean cities north of the fiftieth parallel of South Latitude.", "Knowledge and interest in the northern world, save for a study of coast-lines probably made during long exploration flights on those fan-like membranous wings, had evidently declined to zero among the Old Ones.", "Destruction of cities through the upthrust of mountains, the centrifugal rending of continents, the seismic convulsions of land or sea-bottom, and other natural causes, was a matter of common record; and it was curious to observe how fewer and fewer replacements were made as the ages wore on.", "The vast dead megalopolis that yawned around us seemed to be the last general center of the race\u2014built early in the Cretaceous Age after a titanic earth-buckling had obliterated a still vaster predecessor not far distant.", "It appeared that this general region was the most sacred spot of all, where reputedly the first Old Ones had settled on a primal sea-bottom.", "In the new city\u2014many of whose features we could recognize in the sculptures, but which stretched fully a hundred miles along the mountain range in each direction beyond the farthest limits of our aerial survey\u2014there were reputed to be preserved certain sacred stones forming part of the first sea-bottom city, which thrust up to light after long epochs in the course of the general crumpling of strata.", "Naturally, Danforth and I studied with especial interest and a peculiarly personal sense of awe everything pertaining to the immediate district in which we were.", "Of this local material there was naturally a vast abundance; and on the tangled ground level of the city we were lucky enough to find a house of very late date whose walls, though somewhat damaged by a neighboring rift, contained sculptures of decadent workmanship carrying the story of the region much beyond the period of the Pliocene map whence we derived our last general glimpse of the pre-human world.", "This was the last place we examined in detail, since what we found there gave us a fresh immediate objective.", "Certainly, we were in one of the strangest, weirdest, and most terrible of all the corners of earth\u2019s globe.", "Of all existing lands, it was infinitely the most ancient.", "The conviction grew upon us that this hideous upland must indeed be the fabled nightmare plateau of Leng which even the mad author of the Necronomicon was reluctant to discuss.", "The great mountain chain was tremendously long\u2014starting as a low range at Luitpold Land on the east coast of Weddell Sea and virtually crossing the entire continent.", "That really high part stretched in a mighty arc from about Latitude 82\u00b0, E. Longitude 60\u00b0 to Latitude 70\u00b0, E. Longitude 115\u00b0, with its concave side toward our camp and its seaward end in the region of that long, ice-locked coast whose hills were glimpsed by Wilkes and Mawson at the antarctic circle.", "Yet even more monstrous exaggerations of nature seemed disturbingly close at hand.", "I have said that these peaks are higher than the Himalayas, but the sculptures forbid me to say that they are earth\u2019s highest.", "That grim honor is beyond doubt reserved for something which half the sculptures hesitated to record at all, whilst others approached it with obvious repugnance and trepidation.", "It seems that there was one part of the ancient land\u2014the first part that ever rose from the waters after the earth had flung off the moon and the Old Ones had seeped down, from the stars\u2014which had come to be shunned as vaguely and namelessly evil.", "Cities built there had crumbled before their time, and had been found suddenly deserted.", "Then when the first great earth buckling had convulsed the region in the Comanchian Age, a frightful line of peaks had shot suddenly up amidst the most appalling din and chaos\u2014and earth had received her loftiest and most terrible mountains.", "If the scale of the carvings was correct, these abhorred things must have been much over forty thousand feet high\u2014radically vaster than even the shocking mountains of madness we had crossed.", "They extended, it appeared, from about Latitude 77\u00b0, E. Longitude 70\u00b0 to Latitude 70\u00b0, E. Longitude 100\u00b0\u2014less than three hundred miles away from the dead city, so that we would have spied their dreaded summits in the dim western distance had it not been for that vague, opalescent haze.", "Their northern end must likewise be visible from the long antarctic circle coast line at Queen Mary Land.", "Some of the Old Ones, in the decadent days, had made strange prayers to those mountains\u2014but none ever went near them or dared to guess what lay beyond.", "No human eye had ever seen them, and as I studied the emotions conveyed in the carvings, I prayed that none ever might.", "There are protecting hills along the coast beyond them\u2014Queen Mary and Kaiser Wilhelm Lands\u2014and I thank Heaven no one has been able to land and climb those hills.", "I am not as sceptical about old tales and fears as I used to be, and I do not laugh now at the pre-human sculptor\u2019s notion that lightning paused meaningfully now and then at each of the brooding crests, and that an unexplained glow shone from one of those terrible pinnacles all through the long polar night.", "There may be a very real and very monstrous meaning in the old Pnakotic whispers about Kadath in the Cold Waste.", "But the terrain close at hand was hardly less strange, even if less namelessly accursed.", "Soon after the founding of the city the great mountain range became the seat of the principal temples, and many carvings showed what grotesque and fantastic towers had pierced the sky where now we saw only the curiously clinging cubes and ramparts.", "In the course of ages the caves had appeared, and had been shaped into adjuncts of the temples.", "With the advance of still later epochs, all the limestone veins of the region were hollowed out by ground waters, so that the mountains, the foothills, and the plains below them were a veritable network of connected caverns and galleries.", "Many graphic sculptures told of explorations deep underground, and of the final discovery of the Stygian sunless sea that lurked at earth\u2019s bowels.", "This vast nighted gulf had undoubtedly been worn by the great river which flowed down from the nameless and horrible westward mountains, and which had formerly turned at the base of the Old Ones\u2019 range and flowed beside that chain into the Indian Ocean between Budd and Totten Lands on Wilkes\u2019s coast line.", "Little by little it had eaten away the limestone hill base at its turning, till at last its sapping currents reached the caverns of the ground waters and joined with them in digging a deeper abyss.", "Finally its whole bulk emptied into the hollow hills and left the old bed toward the ocean dry.", "Much of the later city as we now found it had been built over that former bed.", "The Old Ones, understanding what had happened, and exercising their always keen artistic sense, had carved into ornate pylons those headlands of the foothills where the great stream began its descent into eternal darkness.", "This river, once crossed by scores of noble stone bridges, was plainly the one whose extinct course we had seen in our aeroplane survey.", "Its position in different carvings of the city helped us to orient ourselves to the scene as it had been at various stages of the region\u2019s age-long, aeon-dead history, so that we were able to sketch a hasty but careful map of the salient features\u2014squares, important buildings, and the like\u2014for guidance in further explorations.", "We could soon reconstruct in fancy the whole stupendous thing as it was a million or ten million or fifty million years ago, for the sculptures told us exactly what the buildings and mountains and squares and suburbs and landscape setting and luxuriant Tertiary vegetation had looked like.", "It must have had a marvelous and mystic beauty, and as I thought of it, I almost forgot the clammy sense of sinister oppression with which the city\u2019s inhuman age and massiveness and deadness and remoteness and glacial twilight had choked and weighed on my spirit.", "Yet according to certain carvings, the denizens of that city had themselves known the clutch of oppressive terror; for there was a somber and recurrent type of scene in which the Old Ones were shown in the act of recoiling affrightedly from some object\u2014never allowed to appear in the design\u2014found in the great river and indicated as having been washed down through waving, vine-draped cycad forests from those horrible westward mountains.", "It was only in the one late-built house with the decadent carvings that we obtained any foreshadowing of the final calamity leading to the city\u2019s desertion.", "Undoubtedly there must have been many sculptures of the same age elsewhere, even allowing for the slackened energies and aspirations of a stressful and uncertain period; indeed, very certain evidence of the existence of others came to us shortly afterward.", "But this was the first and only set we directly encountered.", "We meant to look farther later on; but as I have said, immediate conditions dictated another present objective.", "There would, though, have been a limit\u2014for after all hope of a long future occupancy of the place had perished among the Old Ones, there could not but have been a complete cessation of mural decoration.", "The ultimate blow, of course, was the coming of the great cold which once held most of the earth in thrall, and which has never departed from the ill-fated poles\u2014the great cold that, at the world\u2019s other extremity, put an end to the fabled lands of Lomar and Hyperborea.", "Just when this tendency began in the antarctic, it would be hard to say in terms of exact years.", "Nowadays we set the beginning of the general glacial periods at a distance of about five hundred thousand years from the present, but at the poles the terrible scourge must have commenced much earlier.", "All quantitative estimates are partly guesswork, but it is quite likely that the decadent sculptures were made considerably less than a million years ago, and that the actual desertion of the city was complete long before the conventional opening of the Pleistocene\u2014five hundred thousand years ago\u2014as reckoned in terms of the earth\u2019s whole surface.", "In the decadent sculptures there were signs of thinner vegetation everywhere, and of a decreased country life on the part of the Old Ones.", "Heating devices were shown in the houses, and winter travelers were represented as muffled in protective fabrics.", "Then we saw a series of cartouches\u2014the continuous band arrangement being frequently interrupted in these late carvings\u2014depicting a constantly growing migration to the nearest refuges of greater warmth\u2014some fleeing to cities under the sea off the far-away coast, and some clambering down through networks of limestone caverns in the hollow hills to the neighboring black abyss of subterrene waters.", "In the end it seems to have been the neighboring abyss which received the greatest colonization.", "This was partly due, no doubt, to the traditional sacredness of this special region, but may have been more conclusively determined by the opportunities it gave for continuing the use of the great temples on the honeycombed mountains, and for retaining the vast land city as a place of summer residence and base of communication with various mines.", "The linkage of old and new abodes was made more effective by means of several gradings and improvements along the connecting routes, including the chiseling of numerous direct tunnels from the ancient metropolis to the black abyss\u2014sharply down-pointing tunnels whose mouths we carefully drew, according to our most thoughtful estimates, on the guide map we were compiling.", "It was obvious that at least two of these tunnels lay within a reasonable exploring distance of where we were\u2014both being on the mountainward edge of the city, one less than a quarter of a mile toward the ancient river-course, and the other perhaps twice that distance in the opposite direction.", "The abyss, it seems, had shelving shores of dry land at certain places, but the Old Ones built their new city under water\u2014no doubt because of its greater certainty of uniform warmth.", "The depth of the hidden sea appears to have been very great, so that the earth\u2019s internal heat could ensure its habitability for an indefinite period.", "The beings seemed to have had no trouble in adapting themselves to part-time\u2014and eventually, of course, whole-time\u2014residence under water, since they had never allowed their gill systems to atrophy.", "There were many sculptures which showed how they had always frequently visited their submarine kinsfolk elsewhere, and how they had habitually bathed on the deep bottom of their great river.", "The darkness of inner earth could likewise have been no deterrent to a race accustomed to long antarctic nights.", "Decadent though their style undoubtedly was, these latest carvings had a truly epic quality where they told of the building of the new city in the cavern sea.", "The Old Ones had gone about it scientifically\u2014quarrying insoluble rocks from the heart of the honeycombed mountains, and employing expert workers from the nearest submarine city to perform the construction according to the best methods.", "These workers brought with them all that was necessary to establish the new venture\u2014Shoggoth tissue from which to breed stone lifters and subsequent beasts of burden for the cavern city, and other protoplasmic matter to mold into phosphorescent organisms for lighting purposes.", "At last a mighty metropolis rose on the bottom of that Stygian sea, its architecture much like that of the city above, and its workmanship displaying relatively little decadence because of the precise mathematical element inherent in building operations.", "The newly bred Shoggoths grew to enormous size and singular intelligence, and were represented as taking and executing orders with marvelous quickness.", "They seemed to converse with the Old Ones by mimicking their voices\u2014a sort of musical piping over a wide range, if poor Lake\u2019s dissection had indicated aright\u2014and to work more from spoken commands than from hypnotic suggestions as in earlier times.", "They were, however, kept in admirable control.", "The phosphorescent organisms supplied light with vast effectiveness, and doubtless atoned for the loss of the familiar polar auroras of the outer-world night.", "Art and decoration were pursued, though of course with a certain decadence.", "The Old Ones seemed to realize this falling off themselves, and in many cases anticipated the policy of Constantine the Great by transplanting especially fine blocks of ancient carving from their land city, just as the emperor, in a similar age of decline, stripped Greece and Asia of their finest art to give his new Byzantine capital greater splendors than its own people could create.", "That the transfer of sculptured blocks had not been more extensive was doubtless owing to the fact that the land city was not at first wholly abandoned.", "By the time total abandonment did occur\u2014and it surely must have occurred before the polar Pleistocene was far advanced\u2014the Old Ones had perhaps become satisfied with their decadent art\u2014or had ceased to recognize the superior merit of the older carvings.", "At any rate, the aeon-silent ruins around us had certainly undergone no wholesale sculptural denudation, though all the best separate statues, like other movables, had been taken away.", "The decadent cartouches and dadoes telling this story were, as I have said, the latest we could find in our limited search.", "They left us with a picture of the Old Ones shuttling back and forth betwixt the land city in summer and the sea-cavern city in winter, and sometimes trading with the sea-bottom cities off the antarctic coast.", "By this time the ultimate doom of the land city must have been recognized, for the sculptures showed many signs of the cold\u2019s malign encroachments.", "Vegetation was declining, and the terrible snows of the winter no longer melted completely even in midsummer.", "The saurian livestock were nearly all dead, and the mammals were standing it none too well.", "To keep on with the work of the upper world it had become necessary to adapt some of the amorphous and curiously cold-resistant Shoggoths to land life\u2014a thing the Old Ones had formerly been reluctant to do.", "The great river was now lifeless, and the upper sea had lost most of its denizens except the seals and whales.", "All the birds had flown away, save only the great, grotesque penguins.", "What had happened afterward we could only guess.", "How long had the new sea-cavern city survived?", "Was it still down there, a stony corpse in eternal blackness?", "Had the subterranean waters frozen at last?", "To what fate had the ocean-bottom cities of the outer world been delivered?", "Had any of the Old Ones shifted north ahead of the creeping ice cap?", "Existing geology shows no trace of their presence.", "Had the frightful Mi-Go been still a menace in the outer land world of the north?", "Could one be sure of what might or might not linger, even to this day, in the lightless and unplumbed abysses of earth\u2019s deepest waters?", "Those things had seemingly been able to withstand any amount of pressure\u2014and men of the sea have fished up curious objects at times.", "And has the killer-whale theory really explained the savage and mysterious scars on antarctic seals noticed a generation ago by Borchgrevingk?", "The specimens found by poor Lake did not enter into these guesses, for their geologic setting proved them to have lived at what must have been a very early date in the land city\u2019s history.", "They were, according to their location, certainly not less than thirty million years old, and we reflected that in their day the sea-cavern city, and indeed the cavern itself, had had no existence.", "They would have remembered an older scene, with lush Tertiary vegetation everywhere, a younger land city of flourishing arts around them, and a great river sweeping northward along the base of the mighty mountains toward a far-away tropic ocean.", "And yet we could not help thinking about these specimens\u2014especially about the eight perfect ones that were missing from Lake\u2019s hideously ravaged camp.", "There was something abnormal about that whole business\u2014the strange things we had tried so hard to lay to somebody\u2019s madness\u2014those frightful graves\u2014the amount and nature of the missing material\u2014Gedney\u2014the unearthly toughness of those archaic monstrosities, and the queer vital freaks the sculptures now showed the race to have\u2014Danforth and I had seen a good deal in the last few hours, and were prepared to believe and keep silent about many appalling and incredible secrets of primal nature.", "I have said that our study of the decadent sculptures brought about a change in our immediate objective.", "This, of course, had to do with the chiseled avenues to the black inner world, of whose existence we had not known before, but which we were now eager to find and traverse.", "From the evident scale of the carvings we deduced that a steeply descending walk of about a mile through either of the neighboring tunnels would bring us to the brink of the dizzy, sunless cliffs above the great abyss; down whose sides paths, improved by the Old Ones, led to the rocky shore of the hidden and nighted ocean.", "To behold this fabulous gulf in stark reality was a lure which seemed impossible of resistance once we knew of the thing\u2014yet we realized we must begin the quest at once if we expected to include it in our present trip.", "It was now 8 P.M., and we did not have enough battery replacements to let our torches burn on forever.", "We had done so much studying and copying below the glacial level that our battery supply had had at least five hours of nearly continuous use, and despite the special dry cell formula, would obviously be good for only about four more\u2014though by keeping one torch unused, except for especially interesting or difficult places, we might manage to eke out a safe margin beyond that.", "It would not do to be without a light in these Cyclopean catacombs, hence in order to make the abyss trip we must give up all further mural deciphering.", "Of course we intended to revisit the place for days and perhaps weeks of intensive study and photography\u2014curiosity having long ago got the better of horror\u2014but just now we must hasten.", "Our supply of trail-blazing paper was far from unlimited, and we were reluctant to sacrifice spare notebooks or sketching paper to augment it, but we did let one large notebook go.", "If worse came to worst we could resort to rock-chipping\u2014and of course it would be possible, even in case of really lost direction, to work up to full daylight by one channel or another if granted sufficient time for plentiful trial and error.", "So at last we set off eagerly in the indicated direction of the nearest tunnel.", "According to the carvings from which we had made our map, the desired tunnel-mouth could not be much more than a quarter of a mile from where we stood; the intervening space showing solid-looking buildings quite likely to be penetrable still at a sub-glacial level.", "The opening itself would be in the basement\u2014on the angle nearest the foothills\u2014of a vast five-pointed structure of evidently public and perhaps ceremonial nature, which we tried to identify from our aerial survey of the ruins.", "No such structure came to our minds as we recalled our flight, hence we concluded that its upper parts had been greatly damaged, or that it had been totally shattered in an ice rift we had noticed.", "In the latter case the tunnel would probably turn out to be choked, so that we would have to try the next nearest one\u2014the one less than a mile to the north.", "The intervening river course prevented our trying any of the more southern tunnels on this trip; and indeed, if both of the neighboring ones were choked it was doubtful whether our batteries would warrant an attempt on the next northerly one\u2014about a mile beyond our second choice.", "As we threaded our dim way through the labyrinth with the aid of map and compass\u2014traversing rooms and corridors in every stage of ruin or preservation, clambering up ramps, crossing upper floors and bridges and clambering down again, encountering choked doorways and piles of debris, hastening now and then along finely preserved and uncannily immaculate stretches, taking false leads and retracing our way (in such cases removing the blind paper trail we had left), and once in a while striking the bottom of an open shaft through which daylight poured or trickled down\u2014we were repeatedly tantalized by the sculptured walls along our route.", "Many must have told tales of immense historical importance, and only the prospect of later visits reconciled us to the need of passing them by.", "As it was, we slowed down once in a while and turned on our second torch.", "If we had had more films, we would certainly have paused briefly to photograph certain bas-reliefs, but time-consuming hand-copying was clearly out of the question.", "I come now once more to a place where the temptation to hesitate, or to hint rather than state, is very strong.", "It is necessary, however, to reveal the rest in order to justify my course in discouraging further exploration.", "We had wormed our way very close to the computed site of the tunnel\u2019s mouth\u2014having crossed a second-story bridge to what seemed plainly the tip of a pointed wall, and descended to a ruinous corridor especially rich in decadently elaborate and apparently ritualistic sculptures of late workmanship\u2014when, shortly before 8:30 P.M., Danforth\u2019s keen young nostrils gave us the first hint of something unusual.", "If we had had a dog with us, I suppose we would have been warned before.", "At first we could not precisely say what was wrong with the formerly crystal-pure air, but after a few seconds our memories reacted only too definitely.", "Let me try to state the thing without flinching.", "There was an odor\u2014and that odor was vaguely, subtly, and unmistakably akin to what had nauseated us upon opening the insane grave of the horror poor Lake had dissected.", "Of course the revelation was not as clearly cut at the time as it sounds now.", "There were several conceivable explanations, and we did a good deal of indecisive whispering.", "Most important of all, we did not retreat without further investigation; for having come this far, we were loath to be balked by anything short of certain disaster.", "Anyway, what we must have suspected was altogether too wild to believe.", "Such things did not happen in any normal world.", "It was probably sheer irrational instinct which made us dim our single torch\u2014tempted no longer by the decadent and sinister sculptures that leered menacingly from the oppressive walls\u2014and which softened our progress to a cautious tiptoeing and crawling over the increasingly littered floor and heaps of debris.", "Danforth\u2019s eyes as well as nose proved better than mine, for it was likewise he who first noticed the queer aspect of the debris after we had passed many half-choked arches leading to chambers and corridors on the ground level.", "It did not look quite as it ought after countless thousands of years of desertion, and when we cautiously turned on more light we saw that a kind of swath seemed to have been lately tracked through it.", "The irregular nature of the litter precluded any definite marks, but in the smoother places there were suggestions of the dragging of heavy objects.", "Once we thought there was a hint of parallel tracks as if of runners.", "This was what made us pause again.", "It was during that pause that we caught\u2014simultaneously this time\u2014the other odor ahead.", "Paradoxically, it was both a less frightful and more frightful odor\u2014less frightful intrinsically, but infinitely appalling in this place under the known circumstances\u2014unless, of course, Gedney\u2014for the odor was the plain and familiar one of common petrol\u2014every-day gasoline.", "Our motivation after that is something I will leave to psychologists.", "We knew now that some terrible extension of the camp horrors must have crawled into this nighted burial place of the aeons, hence could not doubt any longer the existence of nameless conditions\u2014present or at least recent\u2014just ahead.", "Yet in the end we did let sheer burning curiosity\u2014or anxiety\u2014or autohypnotism\u2014or vague thoughts of responsibility toward Gedney\u2014or what not\u2014drive us on.", "Danforth whispered again of the print he thought he had seen at the alley-turning in the ruins above; and of the faint musical piping\u2014potentially of tremendous significance in the light of Lake\u2019s dissection report, despite its close resemblance to the cave-mouth echoes of the windy peaks\u2014which he thought he had shortly afterward half heard from unknown depths below.", "I, in my turn, whispered of how the camp was left\u2014of what had disappeared, and of how the madness of a lone survivor might have conceived the inconceivable\u2014a wild trip across the monstrous mountains and a descent into the unknown, primal masonry\u2014But we could not convince each other, or even ourselves, of anything definite.", "We had turned off all light as we stood still, and vaguely noticed that a trace of deeply filtered upper day kept the blackness from being absolute.", "Having automatically begun to move ahead, we guided ourselves by occasional flashes from our torch.", "The disturbed debris formed an impression we could not shake off, and the smell of gasoline grew stronger.", "More and more ruin met our eyes and hampered our feet, until very soon we saw that the forward way was about to cease.", "We had been all too correct in our pessimistic guess about that rift glimpsed from the air.", "Our tunnel quest was a blind one, and we were not even going to be able to reach the basement out of which the abyssward aperture opened.", "The torch, flashing over the grotesquely carved walls of the blocked corridor in which we stood, showed several doorways in various states of obstruction; and from one of them the gasoline odor\u2014quite submerging that other hint of odor\u2014came with especial distinctness.", "As we looked more steadily, we saw that beyond a doubt there had been a slight and recent clearing away of debris from that particular opening.", "Whatever the lurking horror might be, we believed the direct avenue toward it was now plainly manifest.", "I do not think anyone will wonder that we waited an appreciable time before making any further motion.", "And yet, when we did venture inside that black arch, our first impression was one of anticlimax.", "For amidst the littered expanse of that sculptured Crypt\u2014a perfect cube with sides of about twenty feet\u2014there remained no recent object of instantly discernible size; so that we looked instinctively, though in vain, for a farther doorway.", "In another moment, however, Danforth\u2019s sharp vision had descried a place where the floor debris had been disturbed; and we turned on both torches full strength.", "Though what we saw in that light was actually simple and trifling, I am none the less reluctant to tell of it because of what it implied.", "It was a rough leveling of the debris, upon which several small objects lay carelessly scattered, and at one corner of which a considerable amount of gasoline must have been spilled lately enough to leave a strong odor even at this extreme superplateau altitude.", "In other words, it could not be other than a sort of camp\u2014a camp made by questing beings who, like us, had been turned back by the unexpectedly choked way to the abyss.", "Let me be plain.", "The scattered objects were, so far as substance was concerned, all from Lake\u2019s camp; and consisted of tin cans as queerly opened as those we had seen at that ravaged place, many spent matches, three illustrated books more or less curiously smudged, an empty ink bottle with its pictorial and instructional carton, a broken fountain pen, some oddly snipped fragments of fur and tent-cloth, a used electric battery with circular of directions, a folder that came with our type of tent heater, and a sprinkling of crumpled papers.", "It was all bad enough but when we smoothed out the papers and looked at what was on them, we felt we had come to the worst.", "We had found certain inexplicably blotted papers at the camp which might have prepared us, yet the effect of the sight down there in the pre-human vaults of a nightmare city was almost too much to bear.", "A mad Gedney might have made the groups of dots in imitation of those found on the greenish soapstones, just as the dots on those insane five-pointed grave-mounds might have been made; and he might conceivably have prepared rough, hasty sketches\u2014varying in their accuracy or lack of it\u2014which outlined the neighboring parts of the city and traced the way from a circularly represented place outside our previous route\u2014a place we identified as a great cylindrical tower in the carvings and as a vast circular gulf glimpsed in our aerial survey\u2014to the present five-pointed structure and the tunnel-mouth therein.", "He might, I repeat, have prepared such sketches; for those before us were quite obviously compiled, as our own had been, from late sculptures somewhere in the glacial labyrinth, though not from the ones which we had seen and used.", "But what that art-blind bungler could never have done was to execute those sketches in a strange and assured technique perhaps superior, despite haste and carelessness, to any of the decadent carvings from which they were taken\u2014the characteristic and unmistakable technique of the Old Ones themselves in the dead city\u2019s heyday.", "There are those who will say Danforth and I were utterly mad not to flee for our lives after that; since our conclusions were now\u2014notwithstanding their wildness\u2014completely fixed, and of a nature I need not even mention to those who have read my account as far as this.", "Perhaps we were mad\u2014for have I not said those horrible peaks were mountains of madness?", "But I think I can detect something of the same spirit\u2014albeit in a less extreme form\u2014in the men who stalk deadly beasts through African jungles to photograph them or study their habits.", "Half-paralyzed with terror though we were, there was nevertheless fanned within us a blazing flame of awe and curiosity which triumphed in the end.", "Of course we did not mean to face that\u2014or those\u2014which we knew had been there, but we felt that they must be gone by now.", "They would by this time have found the other neighboring entrance to the abyss, and have passed within, to whatever night-black fragments of the past might await them in the ultimate gulf\u2014the ultimate gulf they had never seen.", "Or if that entrance, too, was blocked, they would have gone on to the north seeking another.", "They were, we remembered, partly independent of light.", "Looking back to that moment, I can scarcely recall just what precise form our new emotions took\u2014just what change of immediate objective it was that so sharpened our sense of expectancy.", "We certainly did not mean to face what we feared\u2014yet I will not deny that we may have had a lurking, unconscious wish to spy certain things from some hidden vantage point.", "Probably we had not given up our zeal to glimpse the abyss itself, though there was interposed a new goal in the form of that great circular place shown on the crumpled sketches we had found.", "We had at once recognized it as a monstrous cylindrical tower figuring in the very earliest carvings, but appearing only as a prodigious round aperture from above.", "Something about the impressiveness of its rendering, even in these hasty diagrams, made us think that its sub-glacial levels must still form a feature of peculiar importance.", "Perhaps it embodied architectural marvels as yet unencountered by us.", "It was certainly of incredible age according to the sculptures in which it figured\u2014being indeed among the first things built in the city.", "Its carvings, if preserved, could not but be highly significant.", "Moreover, it might form a good present link with the upper world\u2014a shorter route than the one we were so carefully blazing, and probably that by which those others had descended.", "At any rate, the thing we did was to study the terrible sketches\u2014which quite perfectly confirmed our own\u2014and start back over the indicated course to the circular place; the course which our nameless predecessors must have traversed twice before us.", "The other neighboring gate to the abyss would lie beyond that.", "I need not speak of our journey\u2014during which we continued to leave an economical trail of paper\u2014for it was precisely the same in kind as that by which we had reached the cul-de-sac; except that it tended to adhere more closely to the ground level and even descend to basement corridors.", "Every now and then we could trace certain disturbing marks in the debris or litter under-foot; and after we had passed outside the radius of the gasoline scent, we were again faintly conscious\u2014spasmodically\u2014of that more hideous and more persistent scent.", "After the way had branched from our former course, we sometimes gave the rays of our single torch a furtive sweep along the walls; noting in almost every case the well-nigh omnipresent sculptures, which indeed seem to have formed a main aesthetic outlet for the Old Ones.", "About 9:30 P.M., while traversing a long, vaulted corridor whose increasingly glaciated floor seemed somewhat below the ground level and whose roof grew lower as we advanced, we began to see strong daylight ahead and were able to turn off our torch.", "It appeared that we were coming to the vast circular place, and that our distance from the upper air could not be very great.", "The corridor ended in an arch surprisingly low for these megalithic ruins, but we could see much through it even before we emerged.", "Beyond there stretched a prodigious round space\u2014fully two hundred feet in diameter\u2014strewn with debris and containing many choked archways corresponding to the one we were about to cross.", "The walls were\u2014in available spaces\u2014boldly sculptured into a spiral band of heroic proportions; and displayed, despite the destructive weathering caused by the openness of the spot, an artistic splendor far beyond anything we had encountered before.", "The littered floor was quite heavily glaciated, and we fancied that the true bottom lay at a considerably lower depth.", "But the salient object of the place was the titanic stone ramp which, eluding the archways by a sharp turn outward into the open floor, wound spirally up the stupendous cylindrical wall like an inside counterpart of those once climbing outside the monstrous towers or ziggurats of antique Babylon.", "Only the rapidity of our flight, and the perspective which confounded the descent with the tower\u2019s inner wall, had prevented our noticing this feature from the air, and thus caused us to seek another avenue to the sub-glacial level.", "Pabodie might have been able to tell what sort of engineering held it in place, but Danforth and I could merely admire and marvel.", "We could see mighty stone corbels and pillars here and there, but what we saw seemed inadequate to the function performed.", "The thing was excellently preserved up to the present top of the tower\u2014a highly remarkable circumstance in view of its exposure\u2014and its shelter had done much to protect the bizarre and disturbing cosmic sculptures on the walls.", "As we stepped out into the awesome half-daylight of this monstrous cylinder-bottom\u2014fifty million years old, and without doubt the most primally ancient structure ever to meet our eyes\u2014we saw that the ramp-traversed sides stretched dizzily up to a height of fully sixty feet.", "This, we recalled from our aerial survey, meant an outside glaciation of some forty feet; since the yawning gulf we had seen from the plane had been at the top of an approximately twenty-foot mound of crumbled masonry, somewhat sheltered for three-fourths of its circumference by the massive curving walls of a line of higher ruins.", "According to the sculptures, the original tower had stood in the center of an immense circular plaza, and had been perhaps five hundred or six hundred feet high, with tiers of horizontal disks near the top, and a row of needle-like spires along the upper rim.", "Most of the masonry had obviously toppled outward rather than inward\u2014a fortunate happening, since otherwise the ramp might have been shattered and the whole interior choked.", "As it was, the ramp showed sad battering; whilst the choking was such that all the archways at the bottom seemed to have been recently cleared.", "It took us only a moment to conclude that this was indeed the route by which those others had descended, and that this would be the logical route for our own ascent despite the long trail of paper we had left elsewhere.", "The tower\u2019s mouth was no farther from the foothills and our waiting plane than was the great terraced building we had entered, and any further sub-glacial exploration we might make on this trip would lie in this general region.", "Oddly, we were still thinking about possible later trips\u2014even after all we had seen and guessed.", "Then, as we picked our way cautiously over the debris of the great floor, there came a sight which for the time excluded all other matters.", "It was the neatly huddled array of three sledges in that farther angle of the ramp\u2019s lower and outward-projecting course which had hitherto been screened from our view.", "There they were\u2014the three sledges missing from Lake\u2019s camp\u2014shaken by a hard usage which must have included forcible dragging along great reaches of snowless masonry and debris, as well as much hand portage over utterly unnavigable places.", "They were carefully and intelligently packed and strapped, and contained things memorably familiar enough: the gasoline stove, fuel cans, instrument cases, provision tins, tarpaulins obviously bulging with books, and some bulging with less obvious contents\u2014everything derived from Lake\u2019s equipment.", "After what we had found in that other room, we were in a measure prepared for this encounter.", "The really great shock came when we stepped over and undid one tarpaulin whose outlines had peculiarly disquieted us.", "It seems that others as well as Lake had been interested in collecting typical specimens; for there were two here, both stiffly frozen, perfectly preserved, patched with adhesive plaster where some wounds around the neck had occurred, and wrapped with care to prevent further damage.", "They were the bodies of young Gedney and the missing dog.", "Many people will probably judge us callous as well as mad for thinking about the northward tunnel and the abyss so soon after our somber discovery, and I am not prepared to say that we would have immediately revived such thoughts but for a specific circumstance which broke in upon us and set up a whole new train of speculations.", "We had replaced the tarpaulin over poor Gedney and were standing in a kind of mute bewilderment when the sounds finally reached our consciousness\u2014the first sounds we had heard since descending out of the open where the mountain wind whined faintly from its unearthly heights.", "Well known and mundane though they were, their presence in this remote world of death was more unexpected and unnerving than any grotesque or fabulous tones could possibly have been\u2014since they gave a fresh upsetting to all our notions of cosmic harmony.", "Had it been some trace of that bizarre musical piping over a wide range which Lake\u2019s dissection report had led us to expect in those others\u2014and which, indeed, our overwrought fancies had been reading into every wind howl we had heard since coming on the camp horror\u2014it would have had a kind of hellish congruity with the aeon-dead region around us.", "A voice from other epochs belongs in a graveyard of other epochs.", "As it was, however, the noise shattered all our profoundly seated adjustments\u2014all our tacit acceptance of the inner antarctic as a waste utterly and irrevocably void of every vestige of normal life.", "What we heard was not the fabulous note of any buried blasphemy of elder earth from whose supernal toughness an age-denied polar sun had evoked a monstrous response.", "Instead, it was a thing so mockingly normal and so unerringly familiarized by our sea days off Victoria Land and our camp days at McMurdo Sound that we shuddered to think of it here, where such things ought not to be.", "To be brief\u2014it was simply the raucous squawking of a penguin.", "The muffled sound floated from sub-glacial recesses nearly opposite to the corridor whence we had come\u2014regions manifestly in the direction of that other tunnel to the vast abyss.", "The presence of a living water-bird in such a direction\u2014in a world whose surface was one of age-long and uniform lifelessness\u2014could lead to only one conclusion; hence our first thought was to verify the objective reality of the sound.", "It was, indeed, repeated, and seemed at times to come from more than one throat.", "Seeking its source, we entered an archway from which much debris had been cleared; resuming our trail-blazing\u2014with an added paper-supply taken with curious repugnance from one of the tarpaulin bundles on the sledges\u2014when we left daylight behind.", "As the glaciated floor gave place to a litter of detritus, we plainly discerned some curious, dragging tracks; and once Danforth found a distinct print of a sort whose description would be only too superfluous.", "The course indicated by the penguin cries was precisely what our map and compass prescribed as an approach to the more northerly tunnel-mouth, and we were glad to find that a bridgeless thoroughfare on the ground and basement levels seemed open.", "The tunnel, according to the chart, ought to start from the basement of a large pyramidal structure which we seemed vaguely to recall from our aerial survey as remarkably well-preserved.", "Along our path the single torch showed a customary profusion of carvings, but we did not pause to examine any of these.", "Suddenly a bulky white shape loomed up ahead of us, and we flashed on the second torch.", "It is odd how wholly this new quest had turned our minds from earlier fears of what might lurk near.", "Those other ones, having left their supplies in the great circular place, must have planned to return after their scouting trip toward or into the abyss; yet we had now discarded all caution concerning them as completely as if they had never existed.", "This white, waddling thing was fully six feet high, yet we seemed to realize at once that it was not one of those others.", "They were larger and dark, and, according to the sculptures, their motion over land surfaces was a swift, assured matter despite the queerness of their sea-born tentacle equipment.", "But to say that the white thing did not profoundly frighten us would be vain.", "We were indeed clutched for an instant by a primitive dread almost sharper than the worst of our reasoned fears regarding those others.", "Then came a flash of anticlimax as the white shape sidled into a lateral archway to our left to join two others of its kind which had summoned it in raucous tones.", "For it was only a penguin\u2014albeit of a huge, unknown species larger than the greatest of the known king penguins, and monstrous in its combined albinism and virtual eyelessness.", "When we had followed the thing into the archway and turned both our torches on the indifferent and unheeding group of three, we saw that they were all eyeless albinos of the same unknown and gigantic species.", "Their size reminded us of some of the archaic penguins depicted in the Old Ones\u2019 sculptures, and it did not take us long to conclude that they were descended from the same stock\u2014undoubtedly surviving through a retreat to some warmer inner region whose perpetual blackness had destroyed their pigmentation and atrophied their eyes to mere useless slits.", "That their present habitat was the vast abyss we sought, was not for a moment to be doubted; and this evidence of the gulf\u2019s continued warmth and habitability filled us with the most curious and subtly perturbing fancies.", "We wondered, too, what had caused these three birds to venture out of their usual domain.", "The state and silence of the great dead city made it clear that it had at no time been an habitual seasonal rookery, whilst the manifest indifference of the trio to our presence made it seem odd that any passing party of those others should have startled them.", "Was it possible that those others had taken some aggressive action or tried to increase their meat supply?", "We doubted whether that pungent odor which the dogs had hated could cause an equal antipathy in these penguins, since their ancestors had obviously lived on excellent terms with the Old Ones\u2014an amicable relationship which must have survived in the abyss below as long as any of the Old Ones remained.", "Regretting\u2014in a flare-up of the old spirit of pure science\u2014that we could not photograph these anomalous creatures, we shortly left them to their squawking and pushed on toward the abyss whose openness was now so positively proved to us, and whose exact direction occasional penguin tracks made clear.", "Not long afterward a steep descent in a long, low, doorless, and peculiarly sculptureless corridor led us to believe that we were approaching the tunnel-mouth at last.", "We had passed two more penguins, and heard others immediately ahead.", "Then the corridor ended in a prodigious open space which made us gasp involuntarily\u2014a perfect inverted hemisphere, obviously deep underground; fully a hundred feet in diameter and fifty feet high, with low archways opening around all parts of the circumference but one, and that one yawning cavernously with a black, arched aperture which broke the symmetry of the vault to a height of nearly fifteen feet.", "It was the entrance to the great abyss.", "In this vast hemisphere, whose concave roof was impressively though decadently carved to a likeness of the primordial celestial dome, a few albino penguins waddled\u2014aliens there, but indifferent and unseeing.", "The black tunnel yawned indefinitely off at a steep, descending grade, its aperture adorned with grotesquely chiseled jambs and lintel.", "From that cryptical mouth we fancied a current of slightly warmer air, and perhaps even a suspicion of vapor proceeded; and we wondered what living entities other than penguins the limitless void below, and the contiguous honeycombings of the land and the titan mountains, might conceal.", "We wondered, too, whether the trace of mountain-top smoke at first suspected by poor Lake, as well as the odd haze we had ourselves perceived around the rampart-crowned peak, might not be caused by the tortuous-channeled rising of some such vapor from the unfathomed regions of earth\u2019s core.", "Entering the tunnel, we saw that its outline was\u2014at least at the start\u2014about fifteen feet each way\u2014sides, floor, and arched roof composed of the usual megalithic masonry.", "The sides were sparsely decorated with cartouches of conventional designs in a late, decadent style; and all the construction and carving were marvelously well-preserved.", "The floor was quite clear, except for a slight detritus bearing outgoing penguin tracks and the inward tracks of these others.", "The farther one advanced, the warmer it became; so that we were soon unbuttoning our heavy garments.", "We wondered whether there were any actually igneous manifestations below, and whether the waters of that sunless sea were hot.", "After a short distance the masonry gave place to solid rock, though the tunnel kept the same proportions and presented the same aspect of carved regularity.", "Occasionally its varying grade became so steep that grooves were cut in the floor.", "Several times we noted the mouths of small lateral galleries not recorded in our diagrams; none of them such as to complicate the problem of our return, and all of them welcome as possible refuges in case we met unwelcome entities on their way back from the abyss.", "The nameless scent of such things was very distinct.", "Doubtless it was suicidally foolish to venture into that tunnel under the known conditions, but the lure of the unplumbed is stronger in certain persons than most suspect\u2014indeed, it was just such a lure which had brought us to this unearthly polar waste in the first place.", "We saw several penguins as we passed along, and speculated on the distance we would have to traverse.", "The carvings had led us to expect a steep downhill walk of about a mile to the abyss, but our previous wanderings had shown us that matters of scale were not wholly to be depended on.", "After about a quarter of a mile that nameless scent became greatly accentuated, and we kept very careful track of the various lateral openings we passed.", "There was no visible vapor as at the mouth, but this was doubtless due to the lack of contrasting cooler air.", "The temperature was rapidly ascending, and we were not surprised to come upon a careless heap of material shudderingly familiar to us.", "It was composed of furs and tent-cloth taken from Lake\u2019s camp, and we did not pause to study the bizarre forms into which the fabrics had been slashed.", "Slightly beyond this point we noticed a decided increase in the size and number of the side galleries, and concluded that the densely honeycombed region beneath the higher foothills must now have been reached.", "The nameless scent was now curiously mixed with another and scarcely less offensive odor\u2014of what nature we could not guess, though we thought of decaying organisms and perhaps unknown subterranean fungi.", "Then came a startling expansion of the tunnel for which the carvings had not prepared us\u2014a broadening and rising into a lofty, natural-looking elliptical cavern with a level floor, some seventy-five feet long and fifty broad, and with many immense side passages leading away into cryptical darkness.", "Though this cavern was natural in appearance, an inspection with both torches suggested that it had been formed by the artificial destruction of several walls between adjacent honeycombings.", "The walls were rough, and the high, vaulted roof was thick with stalactites; but the solid rock floor had been smoothed off, and was free from all debris, detritus, or even dust to a positively abnormal extent.", "Except for the avenue through which we had come, this was true of the floors of all the great galleries opening off from it; and the singularity of the condition was such as to set us vainly puzzling.", "The curious new fetor which had supplemented the nameless scent was excessively pungent here; so much so that it destroyed all trace of the other.", "Something about this whole place, with its polished and almost glistening floor, struck us as more vaguely baffling and horrible than any of the monstrous things we had previously encountered.", "The regularity of the passage immediately ahead, as well as the larger proportion of penguin-droppings there, prevented all confusion as to the right course amidst this plethora of equally great cave mouths.", "Nevertheless we resolved to resume our paper trailblazing if any further complexity should develop; for dust tracks, of course, could no longer be expected.", "Upon resuming our direct progress we cast a beam of torchlight over the tunnel walls\u2014and stopped short in amazement at the supremely radical change which had come over the carvings in this part of the passage.", "We realized, of course, the great decadence of the Old Ones\u2019 sculpture at the time of the tunneling, and had indeed noticed the inferior workmanship of the arabesques in the stretches behind us.", "But now, in this deeper section beyond the cavern, there was a sudden difference wholly transcending explanation\u2014a difference in basic nature as well as in mere quality, and involving so profound and calamitous a degradation of skill that nothing in the hitherto observed rate of decline could have led one to expect it.", "This new and degenerate work was coarse, bold, and wholly lacking in delicacy of detail.", "It was countersunk with exaggerated depth in bands following the same general line as the sparse cartouches of the earlier sections, but the height of the reliefs did not reach the level of the general surface.", "Danforth had the idea that it was a second carving\u2014a sort of palimpsest formed after the obliteration of a previous design.", "In nature it was wholly decorative and conventional, and consisted of crude spirals and angles roughly following the quintile mathematical tradition of the Old Ones, yet seemingly more like a parody than a perpetuation of that tradition.", "We could not get it out of our minds that some subtly but profoundly alien element had been added to the aesthetic feeling behind the technique\u2014an alien element, Danforth guessed, that was responsible for the laborious substitution.", "It was like, yet disturbingly unlike, what we had come to recognize as the Old Ones\u2019 art; and I was persistently reminded of such hybrid things as the ungainly Palmyrene sculptures fashioned in the Roman manner.", "That others had recently noticed this belt of carving was hinted by the presence of a used flashlight battery on the floor in front of one of the most characteristic cartouches.", "Since we could not afford to spend any considerable time in study, we resumed our advance after a cursory look; though frequently casting beams over the walls to see if any further decorative changes developed.", "Nothing of the sort was perceived, though the carvings were in places rather sparse because of the numerous mouths of smooth-floored lateral tunnels.", "We saw and heard fewer penguins, but thought we caught a vague suspicion of an infinitely distant chorus of them somewhere deep within the earth.", "The new and inexplicable odor was abominably strong, and we could detect scarcely a sign of that other nameless scent.", "Puffs of visible vapor ahead bespoke increasing contrasts in temperature, and the relative nearness of the sunless sea-cliffs of the great abyss.", "Then, quite unexpectedly, we saw certain obstructions on the polished floor ahead\u2014obstructions which were quite definitely not penguins\u2014and turned on our second torch after making sure that the objects were quite stationary.", "Still another time have I come to a place where it is very difficult to proceed.", "I ought to be hardened by this stage; but there are some experiences and intimations which scar too deeply to permit of healing, and leave only such an added sensitiveness that memory reinspires all the original horror.", "We saw, as I have said, certain obstructions on the polished floor ahead; and I may add that our nostrils were assailed almost simultaneously by a very curious intensification of the strange prevailing fetor, now quite plainly mixed with the nameless stench of those others which had gone before.", "The light of the second torch left no doubt of what the obstructions were, and we dared approach them only because we could see, even from a distance, that they were quite as past all harming power as had been the six similar specimens unearthed from the monstrous star-mounded graves at poor Lake\u2019s camp.", "They were, indeed, as lacking in completeness as most of those we had unearthed\u2014though it grew plain from the thick, dark-green pool gathering around them that their incompleteness was of infinitely greater recency.", "There seemed to be only four of them, whereas Lake\u2019s bulletins would have suggested no less than eight as forming the group which had preceded us.", "To find them in this state was wholly unexpected, and we wondered what sort of monstrous struggle had occurred down here in the dark.", "Penguins, attacked in a body, retaliate savagely with their beaks, and our ears now made certain the existence of a rookery far beyond.", "Had those others disturbed such a place and aroused murderous pursuit?", "The obstructions did not suggest it, for penguins\u2019 beaks against the tough tissues Lake had dissected could hardly account for the terrible damage our approaching glance was beginning to make out.", "Besides, the huge blind birds we had seen appeared to be singularly peaceful.", "Had there, then, been a struggle among those others, and were the absent four responsible?", "If so, where were they?", "Were they close at hand and likely to form an immediate menace to us?", "We glanced anxiously at some of the smooth-floored lateral passages as we continued our slow and frankly reluctant approach.", "Whatever the conflict was, it had clearly been that which had frightened the penguins into their unaccustomed wandering.", "It must, then, have arisen near that faintly heard rookery in the incalculable gulf beyond, since there were no signs that any birds had normally dwelt here.", "Perhaps, we reflected, there had been a hideous running fight, with the weaker party seeking to get back to the cached sledges when their pursuers finished them.", "One could picture the demoniac fray between namelessly monstrous entities as it surged out of the black abyss with great clouds of frantic penguins squawking and scurrying ahead.", "I say that we approached those sprawling and incomplete obstructions slowly and reluctantly.", "Would to Heaven we had never approached them at all, but had run back at top speed out of that blasphemous tunnel with the greasily smooth floors and the degenerate murals aping and mocking the things they had superseded\u2014run back, before we had seen what we did see, and before our minds were burned with something which will never let us breathe easily again!", "Both of our torches were turned on the prostrate objects, so that we soon realized the dominant factor in their incompleteness.", "Mauled, compressed, twisted, and ruptured as they were, their chief common injury was total decapitation.", "From each one the tentacled starfish-head had been removed; and as we drew near we saw that the manner of removal looked more like some hellish tearing or suction than like any ordinary form of cleavage.", "Their noisome dark-green ichor formed a large, spreading pool; but its stench was half overshadowed by the newer and stranger stench, here more pungent than at any other point along our route.", "Only when we had come very close to the sprawling obstructions could we trace that second, unexplainable fetor to any immediate source\u2014and the instant we did so Danforth, remembering certain very vivid sculptures of the Old Ones\u2019 history in the Permian Age one hundred and fifty million years ago, gave vent to a nerve-tortured cry which echoed hysterically through that vaulted and archaic passage with the evil, palimpsest carvings.", "I came only just short of echoing his cry myself; for I had seen those primal sculptures, too, and had shudderingly admired the way the nameless artist had suggested that hideous slime coating found on certain incomplete and prostrate Old Ones\u2014those whom the frightful Shoggoths had characteristically slain and sucked to a ghastly headlessness in the great war of re-subjugation.", "They were infamous, nightmare sculptures even when telling of age-old, bygone things; for Shoggoths and their work ought not to be seen by human beings or portrayed by any beings.", "The mad author of the Necronomicon had nervously tried to swear that none had been bred on this planet, and that only drugged dreamers had even conceived them.", "Formless protoplasm able to mock and reflect all forms and organs and processes\u2014viscous agglutinations of bubbling cells\u2014rubbery fifteen-foot spheroids infinitely plastic and ductile\u2014slaves of suggestion, builders of cities\u2014more and more sullen, more and more intelligent, more and more amphibious, more and more imitative!", "Great God!", "What madness made even those blasphemous Old Ones willing to use and carve such things?", "And now, when Danforth and I saw the freshly glistening and reflectively iridescent black slime which clung thickly to those headless bodies and stank obscenely with that new, unknown odor whose cause only a diseased fancy could envisage\u2014clung to those bodies and sparkled less voluminously on a smooth part of the accursedly resculptured wall in a series of grouped dots\u2014we understood the quality of cosmic fear to its uttermost depths.", "It was not fear of those four missing others\u2014for all too well did we suspect they would do no harm again.", "Poor devils!", "After all, they were not evil things of their kind.", "They were the men of another age and another order of being.", "Nature had played a hellish jest on them\u2014as it will on any others that human madness, callousness, or cruelty may hereafter dig up in that hideously dead or sleeping polar waste\u2014and this was their tragic homecoming.", "They had not been even savages\u2014for what indeed had they done?", "That awful awakening in the cold of an unknown epoch\u2014perhaps an attack by the furry, frantically barking quadrupeds, and a dazed defense against them and the equally frantic white simians with the queer wrappings and paraphernalia .", ".", ".", "poor Lake, poor Gedney .", ".", ".", "and poor Old Ones!", "Scientists to the last\u2014what had they done that we would not have done in their place?", "God, what intelligence and persistence!", "What a facing of the incredible, just as those carven kinsmen and forbears had faced things only a little less incredible!", "Radiates, vegetables, monstrosities, star-spawn\u2014whatever they had been, they were men!", "They had crossed the icy peaks on whose templed slopes they had once worshipped and roamed among the tree-ferns.", "They had found their dead city brooding under its curse, and had read its carven latter days as we had done.", "They had tried to reach their living fellows in fabled depths of blackness they had never seen\u2014and what had they found?", "All this flashed in unison through the thoughts of Danforth and me as we looked from those headless, slime-coated shapes to the loathsome palimpsest sculptures and the diabolical dot-groups of fresh slime on the wall beside them\u2014looked and understood what must have triumphed and survived down there in the Cyclopean water-city of that nighted, penguin-fringed abyss, whence even now a sinister curling mist had begun to belch pallidly as if in answer to Danforth\u2019s hysterical scream.", "The shock of recognizing that monstrous slime and headlessness had frozen us into mute, motionless statues, and it is only through later conversations that we have learned of the complete identity of our thoughts at that moment.", "It seemed aeons that we stood there, but actually it could not have been more than ten or fifteen seconds.", "That hateful, pallid mist curled forward as if veritably driven by some remoter advancing bulk\u2014and then came a sound which upset much of what we had just decided, and in so doing broke the spell and enabled us to run like mad past squawking, confused penguins over our former trail back to the city, along ice-sunken megalithic corridors to the great open circle, and up that archaic spiral ramp in a frenzied, automatic plunge for the sane outer air and light of day.", "The new sound, as I have intimated, upset much that we had decided; because it was what poor Lake\u2019s dissection had led us to attribute to those we had judged dead.", "It was, Danforth later told me, precisely what he had caught in infinitely muffled form when at that spot beyond the alley corner above the glacial level; and it certainly had a shocking resemblance to the wind-pipings we had both heard around the lofty mountain caves.", "At the risk of seeming puerile I will add another thing, too, if only because of the surprising way Danforth\u2019s impressions chimed with mine.", "Of course common reading is what prepared us both to make the interpretation, though Danforth has hinted at queer notions about unsuspected and forbidden sources to which Poe may have had access when writing his Arthur Gordon Pym a century ago.", "It will be remembered that in that fantastic tale there is a word of unknown but terrible and prodigious significance connected with the antarctic and screamed eternally by the gigantic spectrally snowy birds of that malign region\u2019s core.", "\u201dTekeli-li!", "Tekeli-li!\u201d That, I may admit, is exactly what we thought we heard conveyed by that sudden sound behind the advancing white mist\u2014that insidious musical piping over a singularly wide range.", "We were in full flight before three notes or syllables had been uttered, though we knew that the swiftness of the Old Ones would enable any scream-roused and pursuing survivor of the slaughter to overtake us in a moment if it really wished to do so.", "We had a vague hope, however, that non-aggressive conduct and a display of kindred reason might cause such a being to spare us in case of capture, if only from scientific curiosity.", "After all, if such an one had nothing to fear for itself, it would have no motive in harming us.", "Concealment being futile at this juncture, we used our torch for a running glance behind, and perceived that the mist was thinning.", "Would we see, at last, a complete and living specimen of those others?", "Again came that insidious musical piping\u2014\u201dTekeli-li!", "Tekeli-li!\u201d Then, noting that we were actually gaining on our pursuer, it occurred to us that the entity might be wounded.", "We could take no chances, however, since it was very obviously approaching in answer to Danforth\u2019s scream, rather than in flight from any other entity.", "The timing was too close to admit of doubt.", "Of the whereabouts of that less conceivable and less mentionable nightmare\u2014that fetid, unglimpsed mountain of slime-spewing protoplasm whose race had conquered the abyss and sent land pioneers to re-carve and squirm through the burrows of the hills\u2014we could form no guess; and it cost us a genuine pang to leave this probably crippled Old One\u2014perhaps a lone survivor\u2014to the peril of recapture and a nameless fate.", "Thank Heaven we did not slacken our run.", "The curling mist had thickened again, and was driving ahead with increased speed; whilst the straying penguins in our rear were squawking and screaming and displaying signs of a panic really surprising in view of their relatively minor confusion when we had passed them.", "Once more came that sinister, wide-ranged piping\u2014\u201dTekeli-li!", "Tekeli-li!\u201d We had been wrong.", "The thing was not wounded, but had merely paused on encountering the bodies of its fallen kindred and the hellish slime inscription above them.", "We could never know what that demon message was\u2014but those burials at Lake\u2019s camp had shown how much importance the beings attached to their dead.", "Our recklessly used torch now revealed ahead of us the large open cavern where various ways converged, and we were glad to be leaving those morbid palimpsest sculptures\u2014almost felt even when scarcely seen\u2014behind.", "Another thought which the advent of the cave inspired was the possibility of losing our pursuer at this bewildering focus of large galleries.", "There were several of the blind albino penguins in the open space, and it seemed clear that their fear of the oncoming entity was extreme to the point of unaccountability.", "If at that point we dimmed our torch to the very lowest limit of traveling need, keeping it strictly in front of us, the frightened squawking motions of the huge birds in the mist might muffle our footfalls, screen our true course, and somehow set up a false lead.", "Amidst the churning, spiraling fog, the littered and unglistening floor of the main tunnel beyond this point, as differing from the other morbidly polished burrows, could hardly form a highly distinguishing feature; even, so far as we could conjecture, for those indicated special senses which made the Old Ones partly, though imperfectly, independent of light in emergencies.", "In fact, we were somewhat apprehensive lest we go astray ourselves in our haste.", "For we had, of course, decided to keep straight on toward the dead city; since the consequences of loss in those unknown foothill honeycombings would be unthinkable.", "The fact that we survived and emerged is sufficient proof that the thing did take a wrong gallery whilst we providentially hit on the right one.", "The penguins alone could not have saved us, but in conjunction with the mist they seem to have done so.", "Only a benign fate kept the curling vapors thick enough at the right moment, for they were constantly shifting and threatening to vanish.", "Indeed, they did lift for a second just before we emerged from the nauseously re-sculptured tunnel into the cave; so that we actually caught one first and only half-glimpse of the oncoming entity as we cast a final, desperately fearful glance backward before dimming the torch and mixing with the penguins in the hope of dodging pursuit.", "If the fate which screened us was benign, that which gave us the half-glimpse was infinitely the opposite; for to that flash of semi-vision can be traced a full half of the horror which has ever since haunted us.", "Our exact motive in looking back again was perhaps no more than the immemorial instinct of the pursued to gauge the nature and course of its pursuer; or perhaps it was an automatic attempt to answer a subconscious question raised by one of our senses.", "In the midst of our flight, with all our faculties centered on the problem of escape, we were in no condition to observe and analyze details; yet even so, our latent brain cells must have wondered at the message brought them by our nostrils.", "Afterward we realized what it was\u2014that our retreat from the fetid slime-coating on those headless obstructions, and the coincident approach of the pursuing entity, had not brought us the exchange of stenches which logic called for.", "In the neighborhood of the prostrate things that new and lately unexplainable fetor had been wholly dominant; but by this time it ought to have largely given place to the nameless stench associated with those others.", "This it had not done\u2014for instead, the newer and less bearable smell was now virtually undiluted, and growing more and more poisonously insistent each second.", "So we glanced back\u2014simultaneously, it would appear; though no doubt the incipient motion of one prompted the imitation of the other.", "As we did so we flashed both torches full strength at the momentarily thinned mist; either from sheer primitive anxiety to see all we could, or in a less primitive but equally unconscious effort to dazzle the entity before we dimmed our light and dodged among the penguins of the labyrinth-center ahead.", "Unhappy act!", "Not Orpheus himself, or Lot\u2019s wife, paid much more dearly for a backward glance.", "And again came that shocking, wide-ranged piping\u2014\u201dTekeli-li!", "Tekeli-li!\u201d\n\n\tI might as well be frank\u2014even if I cannot bear to be quite direct\u2014in stating what we saw; though at the time we felt that it was not to be admitted even to each other.", "The words reaching the reader can never even suggest the awfulness of the sight itself.", "It crippled our consciousness so completely that I wonder we had the residual sense to dim our torches as planned, and to strike the right tunnel toward the dead city.", "Instinct alone must have carried us through\u2014perhaps better than reason could have done; though if that was what saved us, we paid a high price.", "Of reason we certainly had little enough left.", "Danforth was totally unstrung, and the first thing I remember of the rest of the journey was hearing him lightheadedly chant an hysterical formula in which I alone of mankind could have found anything but insane irrelevance.", "It reverberated in falsetto echoes among the squawks of the penguins; reverberated through the vaultings ahead, and\u2014thank God\u2014through the now empty vaultings behind.", "He could not have begun it at once\u2014else we would not have been alive and blindly racing.", "I shudder to think of what a shade of difference in his nervous reactions might have brought.", "\u201cSouth Station Under\u2014Washington Under\u2014Park Street Under-Kendall\u2014Central\u2014Harvard.", ".", ".", ".\u201d The poor fellow was chanting the familiar stations of the Boston-Cambridge tunnel that burrowed through our peaceful native soil thousands of miles away in New England, yet to me the ritual had neither irrelevance nor home-feeling.", "It had only horror, because I knew unerringly the monstrous, nefandous analogy that had suggested it.", "We had expected, upon looking back, to see a terrible and incredible moving entity if the mists were thin enough; but of that entity we had formed a clear idea.", "What we did see\u2014for the mists were indeed all too malignly thinned\u2014was something altogether different, and immeasurably more hideous and detestable.", "It was the utter, objective embodiment of the fantastic novelist\u2019s \u201cthing that should not be\u201d; and its nearest comprehensible analogue is a vast, onrushing subway train as one sees it from a station platform\u2014the great black front looming colossally out of infinite subterranean distance, constellated with strangely colored lights and filling the prodigious burrow as a piston fills a cylinder.", "But we were not on a station platform.", "We were on the track ahead as the nightmare, plastic column of fetid black iridescence oozed tightly onward through its fifteen-foot sinus, gathering unholy speed and driving before it a spiral, re-thickening cloud of the pallid abyss-vapor.", "It was a terrible, indescribable thing vaster than any subway train\u2014a shapeless congeries of protoplasmic bubbles, faintly self-luminous, and with myriads of temporary eyes forming and un-forming as pustules of greenish light all over the tunnel-filling front that bore down upon us, crushing the frantic penguins and slithering over the glistening floor that it and its kind had swept so evilly free of all litter.", "Still came that eldritch, mocking cry\u2014\u201dTekeli-li!", "Tekeli-li!\u201d and at last we remembered that the demoniac Shoggoths\u2014given life, thought, and plastic organ patterns solely by the Old Ones, and having no language save that which the dot-groups expressed\u2014had likewise no voice save the imitated accents of their bygone masters.", "Danforth and I have recollections of emerging into the great sculptured hemisphere and of threading our back trail through the Cyclopean rooms and corridors of the dead city; yet these are purely dream-fragments involving no memory of volition, details, or physical exertion.", "It was as if we floated in a nebulous world or dimension without time, causation, or orientation.", "The gray half-daylight of the vast circular space sobered us somewhat; but we did not go near those cached sledges or look again at poor Gedney and the dog.", "They have a strange and titanic mausoleum, and I hope the end of this planet will find them still undisturbed.", "It was while struggling up the colossal spiral incline that we first felt the terrible fatigue and short breath which our race through the thin plateau air had produced; but not even fear of collapse could make us pause before reaching the normal outer realm of sun and sky.", "There was something vaguely appropriate about our departure from those buried epochs; for as we wound our panting way up the sixty-foot cylinder of primal masonry, we glimpsed beside us a continuous procession of heroic sculptures in the dead race\u2019s early and undecayed technique\u2014a farewell from the Old Ones, written fifty million years ago.", "Finally scrambling out at the top, we found ourselves on a great mound of tumbled blocks, with the curved walls of higher stonework rising westward, and the brooding peaks of the great mountains showing beyond the more crumbled structures toward the east.", "The low antarctic sun of midnight peered redly from the southern horizon through rifts in the jagged ruins, and the terrible age and deadness of the nightmare city seemed all the starker by contrast with such relatively known and accustomed things as the features of the polar landscape.", "The sky above was a churning and opalescent mass of tenuous ice-vapors, and the cold clutched at our vitals.", "Wearily resting the outfit-bags to which we had instinctively clung throughout our desperate flight, we rebuttoned our heavy garments for the stumbling climb down the mound and the walk through the aeon-old stone maze to the foothills where our aeroplane waited.", "Of what had set us fleeing from that darkness of earth\u2019s secret and archaic gulfs we said nothing at all.", "In less than a quarter of an hour we had found the steep grade to the foothills\u2014the probable ancient terrace\u2014by which we had descended, and could see the dark bulk of our great plane amidst the sparse ruins on the rising slope ahead.", "Halfway uphill toward our goal we paused for a momentary breathing spell, and turned to look again at the fantastic tangle of incredible stone shapes below us\u2014once more outlined mystically against an unknown west.", "As we did so we saw that the sky beyond had lost its morning haziness; the restless ice-vapors having moved up to the zenith, where their mocking outlines seemed on the point of settling into some bizarre pattern which they feared to make quite definite or conclusive.", "There now lay revealed on the ultimate white horizon behind the grotesque city a dim, elfin line of pinnacled violet whose needle-pointed heights loomed dreamlike against the beckoning rose-color of the western sky.", "Up toward this shimmering rim sloped the ancient table-land, the depressed course of the bygone river traversing it as an irregular ribbon of shadow.", "For a second we gasped in admiration of the scene\u2019s unearthly cosmic beauty, and then vague horror began to creep into our souls.", "For this far violet line could be nothing else than the terrible mountains of the forbidden land\u2014highest of earth\u2019s peaks and focus of earth\u2019s evil; harborers of nameless horrors and Archaean secrets; shunned and prayed to by those who feared to carve their meaning; untrodden by any living thing on earth, but visited by the sinister lightnings and sending strange beams across the plains in the polar night\u2014beyond doubt the unknown archetype of that dreaded Kadath in the Cold Waste beyond abhorrent Leng, whereof primal legends hint evasively.", "We were the first human beings ever to see them\u2014and I hope to God we may be the last.", "If the sculptured maps and pictures in that pre-human city had told truly, these cryptic violet mountains could not be much less than three hundred miles away; yet none the less sharply did their dim elfin essence appear above that remote and snowy rim, like the serrated edge of a monstrous alien planet about to rise into unaccustomed heavens.", "Their height, then, must have been tremendous beyond all comparison\u2014carrying them up into tenuous atmospheric strata peopled only by such gaseous wraiths as rash flyers have barely lived to whisper of after unexplainable falls.", "Looking at them, I thought nervously of certain sculptured hints of what the great bygone river had washed down into the city from their accursed slopes\u2014and wondered how much sense and how much folly had lain in the fears of those Old Ones who carved them so reticently.", "I recalled how their northerly end must come near the coast at Queen Mary Land, where even at that moment Sir Douglas Mawson\u2019s expedition was doubtless working less than a thousand miles away; and hoped that no evil fate would give Sir Douglas and his men a glimpse of what might lie beyond the protecting coastal range.", "Such thoughts formed a measure of my overwrought condition at the time\u2014and Danforth seemed to be even worse.", "Yet long before we had passed the great star-shaped ruin and reached our plane, our fears had become transferred to the lesser but vast-enough range whose recrossing lay ahead of us.", "From these foothills the black, ruin-crusted slopes reared up starkly and hideously against the east, again reminding us of those strange Asian paintings of Nicholas Roerich; and when we thought of the frightful amorphous entities that might have pushed their fetidly squirming way even to the topmost hollow pinnacles, we could not face without panic the prospect of again sailing by those suggestive skyward cave-mouths where the wind made sounds like an evil musical piping over a wide range.", "To make matters worse, we saw distinct traces of local mist around several of the summits\u2014as poor Lake must have done when he made that early mistake about volcanism\u2014and thought shiveringly of that kindred mist from which we had just escaped; of that, and of the blasphemous, horror-fostering abyss whence all such vapors came.", "All was well with the plane, and we clumsily hauled on our heavy flying furs.", "Danforth got the engine started without trouble, and we made a very smooth take-off over the nightmare city.", "Below us the primal Cyclopean masonry spread out as it had done when first we saw it\u2014so short, yet infinitely long, a time ago\u2014and we began rising and turning to test the wind for our crossing through the pass.", "At a very high level there must have been great disturbance, since the ice-dust clouds of the zenith were doing all sorts of fantastic things; but at twenty-four thousand feet, the height we needed for the pass, we found navigation quite practicable.", "As we drew close to the jutting peaks the wind\u2019s strange piping again became manifest, and I could see Danforth\u2019s hands trembling at the controls.", "Rank amateur that I was, I thought at that moment that I might be a better navigator than he in effecting the dangerous crossing between pinnacles; and when I made motions to change seats and take over his duties he did not protest.", "I tried to keep all my skill and self-possession about me, and stared at the sector of reddish farther sky betwixt the walls of the pass\u2014resolutely refusing to pay attention to the puffs of mountain-top vapor, and wishing that I had wax-stopped ears like Ulysses\u2019 men off the Siren\u2019s coast to keep that disturbing windpiping from my consciousness.", "But Danforth, released from his piloting and keyed up to a dangerous nervous pitch, could not keep quiet.", "I felt him turning and wriggling about as he looked back at the terrible receding city, ahead at the cave-riddled, cube-barnacled peaks, sidewise at the bleak sea of snowy, rampart-strewn foothills, and upward at the seething, grotesquely clouded sky.", "It was then, just as I was trying to steer safely through the pass, that his mad shrieking brought us so close to disaster by shattering my tight hold on myself and causing me to fumble helplessly with the controls for a moment.", "A second afterward my resolution triumphed and we made the crossing safely\u2014yet I am afraid that Danforth will never be the same again.", "I have said that Danforth refused to tell me what final horror made him scream out so insanely\u2014a horror which, I feel sadly sure, is mainly responsible for his present breakdown.", "We had snatches of shouted conversation above the wind\u2019s piping and the engine\u2019s buzzing as we reached the safe side of the range and swooped slowly down toward the camp, but that had mostly to do with the pledges of secrecy we had made as we prepared to leave the nightmare city.", "Certain things, we had agreed, were not for people to know and discuss lightly\u2014and I would not speak of them now but for the need of heading off that Starkweather-Moore Expedition, and others, at any cost.", "It is absolutely necessary, for the peace and safety of mankind, that some of earth\u2019s dark, dead corners and unplumbed depths be let alone; lest sleeping abnormalities wake to resurgent life, and blasphemously surviving nightmares squirm and splash out of their black lairs to newer and wider conquests.", "All that Danforth has ever hinted is that the final horror was a mirage.", "It was not, he declares, anything connected with the cubes and caves of those echoing, vaporous, wormily-honeycombed mountains of madness which we crossed; but a single fantastic, demoniac glimpse, among the churning zenith-clouds, of what lay back of those other violet westward mountains which the Old Ones had shunned and feared.", "It is very probable that the thing was a sheer delusion born of the previous stresses we had passed through, and of the actual though unrecognized mirage of the dead transmontane city experienced near Lake\u2019s camp the day before; but it was so real to Danforth that he suffers from it still.", "He has on rare occasions whispered disjointed and irresponsible things about \u201cThe black pit,\u201d \u201cthe carven rim,\u201d \u201cthe proto-Shoggoths,\u201d \u201cthe windowless solids with five dimensions,\u201d \u201cthe nameless cylinder,\u201d \u201cthe elder Pharos,\u201d \u201cYog-Sothoth,\u201d \u201cthe primal white jelly,\u201d \u201cthe color out of space,\u201d \u201cthe wings,\u201d \u201cthe eyes in darkness,\u201d \u201cthe moon-ladder,\u201d \u201cthe original, the eternal, the undying,\u201d and other bizarre conceptions; but when he is fully himself he repudiates all this and attributes it to his curious and macabre reading of earlier years.", "Danforth, indeed, is known to be among the few who have ever dared go completely through that worm-riddled copy of the Necronomicon kept under lock and key in the college library.", "The higher sky, as we crossed the range, was surely vaporous and disturbed enough; and although I did not see the zenith, I can well imagine that its swirls of ice dust may have taken strange forms.", "Imagination, knowing how vividly distant scenes can sometimes be reflected, refracted, and magnified by such layers of restless cloud, might easily have supplied the rest\u2014and, of course, Danforth did not hint any of these specific horrors till after his memory had had a chance to draw on his bygone reading.", "He could never have seen so much in one instantaneous glance.", "At the time, his shrieks were confined to the repetition of a single, mad word of all too obvious source: \u201dTekeli-li!", "Tekeli-li!\u201d", "\tAFTER twenty-two years of nightmare and terror, saved only by a desperate conviction of the mythical source of certain impressions, I am unwilling to vouch for the truth of that which I think I found in Western Australia on the night of 17-18 July 1935.", "There is reason to hope that my experience was wholly or partly an hallucination\u2014for which, indeed, abundant causes existed.", "And yet, its realism was so hideous that I sometimes find hope impossible.", "If the thing did happen, then man must be prepared to accept notions of the cosmos, and of his own place in the seething vortex of time, whose merest mention is paralysing.", "He must, too, be placed on guard against a specific, lurking peril which, though it will never engulf the whole race, may impose monstrous and unguessable horrors upon certain venturesome members of it.", "It is for this latter reason that I urge, with all the force of my being, final abandonment of all the attempts at unearthing those fragments of unknown, primordial masonry which my expedition set out to investigate.", "Assuming that I was sane and awake, my experience on that night was such as has befallen no man before.", "It was, moreover, a frightful confirmation of all I had sought to dismiss as myth and dream.", "Mercifully there is no proof, for in my fright I lost the awesome object which would\u2014if real and brought out of that noxious abyss\u2014have formed irrefutable evidence.", "When I came upon the horror I was alone\u2014and I have up to now told no one about it.", "I could not stop the others from digging in its direction, but chance and the shifting sand have so far saved them from finding it.", "Now I must formulate some definite statement\u2014not only for the sake of my own mental balance, but to warn such others as may read it seriously.", "These pages\u2014much in whose earlier parts will be familiar to close readers of the general and scientific press\u2014are written in the cabin of the ship that is bringing me home.", "I shall give them to my son, Professor Wingate Peaslee of Miskatonic University\u2014the only member of my family who stuck to me after my queer amnesia of long ago, and the man best informed on the inner facts of my case.", "Of all living persons, he is least likely to ridicule what I shall tell of that fateful night.", "I did not enlighten him orally before sailing, because I think he had better have the revelation in written form.", "Reading and re-reading at leisure will leave with him a more convincing picture than my confused tongue could hope to convey.", "He can do anything that he thinks best with this account\u2014showing it, with suitable comment, in any quarters where it will be likely to accomplish good.", "It is for the sake of such readers as are unfamiliar with the earlier phases of my case that I am prefacing the revelation itself with a fairly ample summary of its background.", "My name is Nathaniel Wingate Peaslee, and those who recall the newspaper tales of a generation back\u2014or the letters and articles in psychological journals six or seven years ago\u2014will know who and what I am.", "The press was filled with the details of my strange amnesia in 1908-13, and much was made of the traditions of horror, madness, and witchcraft which lurked behind the ancient Massachusetts town then and now forming my place of residence.", "Yet I would have it known that there is nothing whatever of the mad or sinister in my heredity and early life.", "This is a highly important fact in view of the shadow which fell so suddenly upon me from outside sources.", "It may be that centuries of dark brooding had given to crumbling, whisper-haunted Arkham a peculiar vulnerability as regards such shadows\u2014though even this seems doubtful in the light of those other cases which I later came to study.", "But the chief point is that my own ancestry and background are altogether normal.", "What came, came from somewhere else\u2014where I even now hesitate to assert in plain words.", "I am the son of Jonathan and Hannah (Wingate) Peaslee, both of wholesome old Haverhill stock.", "I was born and reared in Haverhill\u2014at the old homestead in Boardman Street near Golden Hill\u2014and did not go to Arkham till I entered Miskatonic University as instructor of political economy in 1895.", "For thirteen years more my life ran smoothly and happily.", "I married Alice Keezar of Haverhill in 1896, and my three children, Robert, Wingate and Hannah were born in 1898, 1900, and 1903, respectively.", "In 1898 I became an associate professor, and in 1902 a full professor.", "At no time had I the least interest in either occultism or abnormal psychology.", "It was on Thursday, 14 May 1908, that the queer amnesia came.", "The thing was quite sudden, though later I realized that certain brief, glimmering visions of several hours previous\u2014chaotic visions which disturbed me greatly because they were so unprecedented\u2014must have formed premonitory symptoms.", "My head was aching, and I had a singular feeling\u2014altogether new to me\u2014that some one else was trying to get possession of my thoughts.", "The collapse occurred about 10.20 A.M., while I was conducting a class in Political Economy VI\u2014history and present tendencies of economics\u2014for juniors and a few sophomores.", "I began to see strange shapes before my eyes, and to feel that I was in a grotesque room other than the classroom.", "My thoughts and speech wandered from my subject, and the students saw that something was gravely amiss.", "Then I slumped down, unconscious, in my chair, in a stupor from which no one could arouse me.", "Nor did my rightful faculties again look out upon the daylight of our normal world for five years, four months, and thirteen days.", "It is, of course, from others that I have learned what followed.", "I showed no sign of consciousness for sixteen and a half hours though removed to my home at 27 Crane Street, and given the best of medical attention.", "At 3 A.M. 15 May my eyes opened and I began to speak, but before long the doctor and my family were thoroughly frightened by the trend of my expression and language.", "It was clear that I had no remembrance of my identity and my past, though for some reason I seemed anxious to conceal this lack of knowledge.", "My eyes glazed strangely at the persons around me, and the flections of my facial muscles were altogether unfamiliar.", "Even my speech seemed awkward and foreign.", "I used my vocal organs clumsily and gropingly, and my diction had a curiously stilted quality, as if I had laboriously learned the English language from books.", "The pronunciation was barbarously alien, whilst the idiom seemed to include both scraps of curious archaism and expressions of a wholly incomprehensible cast.", "Of the latter, one in particular was very potently\u2014even terrifiedly\u2014recalled by the youngest of the physicians twenty years afterward.", "For at that late period such a phrase began to have an actual currency\u2014first in England and then in the United States\u2014and though of much complexity and indisputable newness, it reproduced in every least particular the mystifying words of the strange Arkham patient of 1908.", "Physical strength returned at once, although I required an odd amount of re-education in the use of my hands, legs, and bodily apparatus in general.", "Because of this and other handicaps inherent in the mnemonic lapse, I was for some time kept under strict medical care.", "When I saw that my attempts to conceal the lapse had failed, I admitted it openly, and became eager for information of all sorts.", "Indeed, it seemed to the doctors that I lost interest in my proper personality as soon as I found the case of amnesia accepted as a natural thing.", "They noticed that my chief efforts were to master certain points in history, science, art, language, and folklore\u2014some of them tremendously abstruse, and some childishly simple\u2014which remained, very oddly in many cases, outside my consciousness.", "At the same time they noticed that I had an inexplicable command of many almost unknown sorts of knowledge\u2014a command which I seemed to wish to hide rather than display.", "I would inadvertently refer, with casual assurance, to specific events in dim ages outside of the range of accepted history\u2014passing off such references as a jest when I saw the surprise they created.", "And I had a way of speaking of the future which two or three times caused actual fright.", "These uncanny flashes soon ceased to appear, though some observers laid their vanishment more to a certain furtive caution on my part than to any waning of the strange knowledge behind them.", "Indeed, I seemed anomalously avid to absorb the speech, customs, and perspectives of the age around me; as if I were a studious traveller from a far, foreign land.", "As soon as permitted, I haunted the college library at all hours; and shortly began to arrange for those odd travels, and special courses at American and European Universities, which evoked so much comment during the next few years.", "I did not at any time suffer from a lack of learned contacts, for my case had a mild celebrity among the psychologists of the period.", "I was lectured upon as a typical example of secondary personality\u2014even though I seemed to puzzle the lecturers now and then with some bizarre symptoms or some queer trace of carefully veiled mockery.", "Of real friendliness, however, I encountered little.", "Something in my aspect and speech seemed to excite vague fears and aversions in every one I met, as if I were a being infinitely removed from all that is normal and healthful.", "This idea of a black, hidden horror connected with incalculable gulfs of some sort of distance was oddly widespread and persistent.", "My own family formed no exception.", "From the moment of my strange waking my wife had regarded me with extreme horror and loathing, vowing that I was some utter alien usurping the body of her husband.", "In 1910 she obtained a legal divorce, nor would she ever consent to see me even after my return to normality in 1913.", "These feelings were shared by my elder son and my small daughter, neither of whom I have ever seen since.", "Only my second son, Wingate, seemed able to conquer the terror and repulsion which my change aroused.", "He indeed felt that I was a stranger, but though only eight years old held fast to a faith that my proper self would return.", "When it did return he sought me out, and the courts gave me his custody.", "In succeeding years he helped me with the studies to which I was driven, and today, at thirty-five, he is a professor of psychology at Miskatonic.", "But I do not wonder at the horror caused\u2014for certainly, the mind, voice, and facial expression of the being that awakened on 15 May 1908, were not those of Nathaniel Wingate Peaslee.", "I will not attempt to tell much of my life from 1908 to 1913, since readers may glean the outward essentials\u2014as I largely had to do\u2014from files of old newspapers and scientific journals.", "I was given charge of my funds, and spent them slowly and on the whole wisely, in travel and in study at various centres of learning.", "My travels, however, were singular in the extreme, involving long visits to remote and desolate places.", "In 1909 I spent a month in the Himalayas, and in 1911 roused much attention through a camel trip into the unknown deserts of Arabia.", "What happened on those journeys I have never been able to learn.", "During the summer of 1912 I chartered a ship and sailed in the Arctic, north of Spitzbergen, afterward showing signs of disappointment.", "Later in that year I spent weeks\u2014alone beyond the limits of previous or subsequent exploration in the vast limestone cavern systems of western Virginia\u2014black labyrinths so complex that no retracing of my steps could even be considered.", "My sojourns at the universities were marked by abnormally rapid assimilation, as if the secondary personality had an intelligence enormously superior to my own.", "I have found, also, that my rate of reading and solitary study was phenomenal.", "I could master every detail of a book merely by glancing over it as fast as I could turn the leaves; while my skill at interpreting complex figures in an instant was veritably awesome.", "At times there appeared almost ugly reports of my power to influence the thoughts and acts of others, though I seemed to have taken care to minimize displays of this faculty.", "Other ugly reports concerned my intimacy with leaders of occultist groups, and scholars suspected of connection with nameless bands of abhorrent elder-world hierophants.", "These rumours, though never proved at the time, were doubtless stimulated by the known tenor of some of my reading\u2014for the consultation of rare books at libraries cannot be effected secretly.", "There is tangible proof\u2014in the form of marginal notes\u2014that I went minutely through such things as the Comte d'Erlette's Cultes des Goules, Ludvig Prinn's De Vermis Mysteriis, the Unaussprechlichen Kulten of von Junzt, the surviving fragments of the puzzling Book of Eibon, and the dreaded Necronomicon of the mad Arab Abdul Alhazred.", "Then, too, it is undeniable that a fresh and evil wave of underground cult activity set in about the time of my odd mutation.", "In the summer of 1913 I began to display signs of ennui and flagging interest, and to hint to various associates that a change might soon be expected in me.", "I spoke of returning memories of my earlier life\u2014though most auditors judged me insincere, since all the recollections I gave were casual, and such as might have been learned from my old private papers.", "About the middle of August I returned to Arkham and re-opened my long-closed house in Crane Street.", "Here I installed a mechanism of the most curious aspect, constructed piecemeal by different makers of scientific apparatus in Europe and America, and guarded carefully from the sight of any one intelligent enough to analyse it.", "Those who did see it\u2014a workman, a servant, and the new housekeeper\u2014say that it was a queer mixture of rods, wheels, and mirrors, though only about two feet tall, one foot wide, and one foot thick.", "The central mirror was circular and convex.", "All this is borne out by such makers of parts as can be located.", "On the evening of Friday, 26 September, I dismissed the housekeeper and the maid until noon of the next day.", "Lights burned in the house till late, and a lean, dark, curiously foreign-looking man called in an automobile.", "It was about one A.M. that the lights were last seen.", "At 2.15 A.M. a policeman observed the place in darkness, but the stranger's motor still at the curb.", "By 4 o'clock the motor was certainly gone.", "It was at 6 o'clock that a hesitant, foreign voice on the telephone asked Dr Wilson to call at my house and bring me out of a peculiar faint.", "This call\u2014a long-distance one\u2014was later traced to a public booth in the North Station in Boston, but no sign of the lean foreigner was ever unearthed.", "When the doctor reached my house he found me unconscious in the sitting room\u2014in an easy-chair with a table drawn up before it.", "On the polished top were scratches showing where some heavy object had rested.", "The queer machine was gone, nor was anything afterward heard of it.", "Undoubtedly the dark, lean foreigner had taken it away.", "In the library grate were abundant ashes, evidently left from the burning of the every remaining scrap of paper on which I had written since the advent of the amnesia.", "Dr Wilson found my breathing very peculiar, but after a hypodermic injection it became more regular.", "At 11.15 A.M., 27 September, I stirred vigorously, and my hitherto masklike face began to show signs of expression.", "Dr Wilson remarked that the expression was not that of my secondary personality, but seemed much like that of my normal self.", "About 11.30 I muttered some very curious syllables\u2014syllables which seemed unrelated to any human speech.", "I appeared, too, to struggle against something.", "Then, just afternoon\u2014the housekeeper and the maid having meanwhile returned\u2014I began to mutter in English.", "\"\u2014of the orthodox economists of that period, Jevons typifies the prevailing trend toward scientific correlation.", "His attempt to link the commercial cycle of prosperity and depression with the physical cycle of the solar spots forms perhaps the apex of\u2014\"\n\n\tNathaniel Wingate Peaslee had come back\u2014a spirit in whose time scale it was still Thursday morning in 1908, with the economics class gazing up at the battered desk on the platform.", "MY reabsorption into normal life was a painful and difficult process.", "The loss of over five years creates more complications than can be imagined, and in my case there were countless matters to be adjusted.", "What I heard of my actions since 1908 astonished and disturbed me, but I tried to view the matter as philosophically as I could.", "At last, regaining custody of my second son, Wingate, I settled down with him in the Crane Street house and endeavoured to resume my teaching\u2014my old professorship having been kindly offered me by the college.", "I began work with the February, 1914, term, and kept at it just a year.", "By that time I realized how badly my experience had shaken me.", "Though perfectly sane\u2014I hoped\u2014and with no flaw in my original personality, I had not the nervous energy of the old days.", "Vague dreams and queer ideas continually haunted me, and when the outbreak of the World War turned my mind to history I found myself thinking of periods and events in the oddest possible fashion.", "My conception of time, my ability to distinguish between consecutiveness and simultaneousness\u2014seemed subtly disordered so that I formed chimerical notions about living in one age and casting one's mind all over eternity for knowledge of past and future ages.", "The war gave me strange impressions of remembering some of its far-off consequences\u2014as if I knew how it was coming out and could look back upon it in the light of future information.", "All such quasi-memories were attended with much pain, and with a feeling that some artificial psychological barrier was set against them.", "When I diffidently hinted to others about my impressions I met with varied responses.", "Some persons looked uncomfortably at me, but men in the mathematics department spoke of new developments in those theories of relativity\u2014then discussed only in learned circles\u2014which were later to become so famous.", "Dr. Albert Einstein, they said, was rapidly reducing time to the status of a mere dimension.", "But the dreams and disturbed feelings gained on me, so that I had to drop my regular work in 1915.", "Certainly the impressions were taking an annoying shape\u2014giving me the persistent notion that my amnesia had formed some unholy sort of exchange; that the secondary personality had indeed had suffered displacement.", "Thus I was driven to vague and fright speculations concerning the whereabouts of my true self during the years that another had held my body.", "The curious knowledge and strange conduct of my body's late tenant troubled me more and more as I learned further details from persons, papers, and magazines.", "Queernesses that had baffled others seemed to harmonize terribly with some background of black knowledge which festered in the chasms of my subconscious.", "I began to search feverishly for every scrap of information bearing on the studies and travels of that other one during the dark years.", "Not all of my troubles were as semi-abstract as this.", "There were the dreams\u2014and these seemed to grow in vividness and concreteness.", "Knowing how most would regard them, I seldom mentioned them to anyone but my son or certain trusted psychologists, but eventually I commenced a scientific study of other cases in order to see how typical or nontypical such visions might be among amnesia victims.", "My results, aided by psychologists, historians, anthropologists, and mental specialists of wide experience, and by a study that included all records of split personalities from the days of daemonic-possession legends to the medically realistic present, at first bothered me more than they consoled me.", "I soon found that my dreams had, indeed, no counterpart in the overwhelming bulk of true amnesia cases.", "There remained, however, a tiny residue of accounts which for years baffled and shocked me with their parallelism to my own experience.", "Some of them were bits of ancient folklore; others were case histories in the annals of medicine; one or two were anecdotes obscurely buried in standard histories.", "It thus appeared that, while my special kind of affliction was prodigiously rare, instances of it had occurred at long intervals ever since the beginning of men's annals.", "Some centuries might contain one, two, or three cases, others none\u2014or at least none whose record survived.", "The essence was always the same\u2014a person of keen thoughtfulness seized a strange secondary life and leading for a greater or lesser period an utterly alien existence typified at first by vocal and bodily awkwardness, and later by a wholesale acquisition of scientific, historic, artistic, and anthropologic knowledge; an acquisition carried on with feverish zest and with a wholly abnormal absorptive power.", "Then a sudden return of rightful consciousness, intermittently plagued ever after with vague unplaceable dreams suggesting fragments of some hideous memory elaborately blotted out.", "And the close resemblance of those nightmares to my own\u2014even in some of the smallest particulars\u2014left no doubt in my mind of their significantly typical nature.", "One or two of the cases had an added ring of faint, blasphemous familiarity, as if I had heard of them before through some cosmic channel too morbid and frightful to contemplate.", "In three instances there was specific mention of such an unknown machine as had been in my house before the second change.", "Another thing that worried me during my investigation was the somewhat greater frequency of cases where a brief, elusive glimpse of the typical nightmares was afforded to persons not visited well-defined amnesia.", "These persons were largely of mediocre mind or less\u2014some so primitive that they could scarcely be thought of as vehicles for abnormal scholarship and preternatural mental acquisitions.", "For a second they would be fired with alien force\u2014then a backward lapse, and a thin, swift-fading memory of unhuman horrors.", "There had been at least three such cases during the past half century\u2014one only fifteen years before.", "Had something been groping blindly through time from some unsuspected abyss in Nature?", "Were these faint cases monstrous, sinister experiments of a kind and authorship utterly beyond sane belief?", "Such were a few of the formless speculations of my weaker hours\u2014fancies abetted by myths which my studies uncovered.", "For I could not doubt but that certain persistent legends of immemorial antiquity, apparently unknown to the victims and physicians connected with recent amnesia cases, formed a striking and awesome elaboration of memory lapses such as mine.", "Of the nature of the dreams and impressions which were growing so clamorous I still almost fear to speak.", "They seemed to savor of madness, and at times I believed I was indeed going mad.", "Was there a special type of delusion afflicting those who had suffered lapses of memory?", "Conceivably, the efforts of the subconscious mind to fill up a perplexing blank with pseudo-memories might give rise to strange imaginative vagaries.", "This indeed\u2014though an alternative folklore theory finally seemed to me more plausible\u2014was the belief of many of the alienists who helped me in my search for parallel cases, and who shared my puzzlement at the exact resemblances sometimes discovered.", "They did not call the condition true insanity, but classed it rather among neurotic disorders.", "My course in trying to track down and analyze it, instead of vainly seeking to dismiss or forget it, they heartily endorsed as correct according to the best psychological principles.", "I especially valued the advice of such physicians as had studied me during my possession by the other personality.", "My first disturbances were not visual at all, but concerned the more abstract matters which I have mentioned.", "There was, too, a feeling of profound and inexplicable horror concerning myself.", "I developed a queer fear of seeing my own form, as if my eyes would find it something utterly alien and inconceivably abhorrent.", "When I did glance down and behold the familiar human shape in quiet grey or blue clothing, I always felt a curious relief, though in order to gain this relief I had to conquer an infinite dread.", "I shunned mirrors as much as possible, and was always shaved at the barber's.", "It was a long time before I correlated any of these disappointed feelings with the fleeting, visual impressions which began to develop.", "The first such correlation had to do with the odd sensation of an external, artificial restraint on my memory.", "I felt that the snatches of sight I experienced had a profound and terrible meaning, and a frightful connexion with myself, but that some purposeful influence held me from grasping that meaning and that connexion.", "Then came that queerness about the element of time, and with it desperate efforts to place the fragmentary dream-glimpses in the chronological and spatial pattern.", "The glimpses themselves were at first merely strange rather than horrible.", "I would seem to be in an enormous vaulted chamber whose lofty stone groinings were well-nigh lost in the shadows overhead.", "In whatever time or place the scene might be, the principle of the arch was known as fully and used as extensively as by the Romans.", "There were colossal, round windows and high, arched doors, and pedestals or tables each as tall as the height of an ordinary room.", "Vast shelves of dark wood lined the walls, holding what seemed to be volumes of immense size with strange hieroglyphs on their backs.", "The exposed stonework held curious carvings, always in curvilinear mathematical designs, and there were chiselled inscriptions in the same characters that the huge books bore.", "The dark granite masonry was of a monstrous megathic type, with lines of convex-topped blocks fitting the concave-bottomed courses which rested upon them.", "There were no chairs, but the tops of the vast pedestals were littered with books, papers, and what seemed to be writing materials\u2014oddly figured jars of a purplish metal, and rods with stained tips.", "Tall as the pedestals were, I seemed at times able to view them from above.", "On some of them were great globes of luminous crystal serving as lamps, and inexplicable machines formed of vitreous tubes and metal rods.", "The windows were glazed, and latticed with stout-looking bars.", "Though I dared not approach and peer out them, I could see from where I was the waving tops of singular fern-like growths.", "The floor was of massive octagonal flagstones, while rugs and hangings were entirely lacking.", "Later I had visions of sweeping through Cyclopean corridors of stone, and up and down gigantic inclined planes of the same monstrous masonry.", "There were no stairs anywhere, nor was any passageway less than thirty feet wide.", "Some of the structures through which I floated must have towered in the sky for thousands of feet.", "There were multiple levels of black vaults below, and never-opened trap-doors, sealed down with metal bands and holding dim suggestions of some special peril.", "I seemed to be a prisoner, and horror hung broodingly over everything I saw.", "I felt that the mocking curvilinear hieroglyphs on the walls would blast my soul with their message were I not guarded by a merciful ignorance.", "Still later my dreams included vistas from the great round windows, and from the titanic flat roof, with its curious gardens, wide barren area, and high, scalloped parapet of stone, to which the topmost of the inclined planes led.", "There were, almost endless leagues of giant buildings, each in its garden, and ranged along paved roads fully 200 feet wide.", "They differed greatly in aspect, but few were less than 500 feet square or a thousand feet high.", "Many seemed so limitless that they must have had a frontage of several thousand feet, while some shot up to mountainous altitudes in the grey, steamy heavens.", "They seemed to be mainly of stone or concrete, and most of them embodied the oddly curvilinear type of masonry noticeable in the building that held me.", "Roofs were flat and garden-covered, and tended to have scalloped parapets.", "Sometimes there were terraces and higher levels, and wide, cleared spaces amidst the gardens.", "The great roads held hints of motion, but in the earlier visions I could not resolve this impression into details.", "In certain places I beheld enormous dark cylindrical towers which climbed far above any of the other structures.", "These appeared to be of a totally unique nature and shewed signs of prodigious age and dilapidation.", "They were built of a bizarre type of square-cut basalt masonry, and tapered slightly toward their rounded tops.", "Nowhere in any of them could the least traces of windows or other apertures save huge doors be found.", "I noticed also some lower buildings\u2014all crumbling with the weathering of aeons\u2014which resembled these dark, cylindrical towers in basic architecture.", "Around all these aberrant piles of square-cut masonry there hovered an inexplicable aura of menace and concentrated fear, like that bred by the sealed trap-doors.", "The omnipresent gardens were almost terrifying in their strangeness, with bizarre and unfamiliar forms of vegetation nodding over broad paths lined with curiously carven monoliths.", "Abnormally vast fern-like growths predominated\u2014some green, and some of a ghastly, fungoid pallor.", "Among them rose great spectral things resembling calamites, whose bamboo-like trunks towered to fabulous heights.", "Then there were tufted forms like fabulous cycads, and grotesque dark-green shrubs and trees of coniferous aspect.", "Flowers were small, colourless, and unrecognizable, blooming in geometrical beds and at large among the greenery.", "In a few of the terrace and roof-top gardens were larger and more blossoms of most offensive contours and seeming to suggest artificial breeding.", "Fungi of inconceivable size, outlines, and colours speckled the scene in patterns bespeaking some unknown but well-established horticultural tradition.", "In the larger gardens on the ground there seemed to be some attempt to preserve the irregularities of Nature, but on the roofs there was more selectiveness, and more evidences of the topiary art.", "The skies were almost always moist and cloudy, and sometimes I would seem to witness tremendous rains.", "Once in a while, though, there would be glimpses of the sun\u2014which looked abnormally large\u2014and of the moon, whose markings held a touch of difference from the normal that I could never quite fathom.", "When\u2014very rarely\u2014the night sky was clear to any extent, I beheld constellations which were nearly beyond recognition.", "Known outlines were sometimes approximated, but seldom duplicated; and from the position of the few groups I could recognize, I felt I must be in the earth's southern hemisphere, near the Tropic of Capricorn.", "The far horizon was always steamy and indistinct, but I could see that great jungles of unknown tree-ferns, calamites, lepidodendra, and sigillaria lay outside the city, their fantastic frondage waving mockingly in the shifting vapours.", "Now and then there would be suggestions of motion in the sky, but these my early visions never resolved.", "By the autumn of 1914 I began to have infrequent dreams of strange floatings over the city and through the regions around it.", "I saw interminable roads through forests of fearsome growths with mottled, fluted, and banded trunks, and past other cities as strange as the one which persistently haunted me.", "I saw monstrous constructions of black or iridescent tone in glades and clearings where perpetual twilight reigned, and traversed long causeways over swamps so dark that I could tell but little of their moist, towering vegetation.", "Once I saw an area of countless miles strewn with age-blasted basaltic ruins whose architecture had been like that of the few windowless, round-topped towers in the haunting city.", "And once I saw the sea\u2014a boundless, steamy expanse beyond the colossal stone piers of an enormous town of domes and arches.", "Great shapeless suggestions of shadow moved over it, and here and there its surface was vexed with anomalous spoutings.", "AS I have said, it was not immediately that these wild visions began to hold their terrifying quality.", "Certainly, many persons have dreamed intrinsically stranger things\u2014things compounded of unrelated scraps of daily life, pictures, and reading, and arranged in fantastically novel forms by the unchecked caprices of sleep.", "For some time I accepted the visions as natural, even though I had never before been an extravagant dreamer.", "Many of the vague anomalies, I argued, must have come from trivial sources too numerous to track down; while others seemed to reflect a common text book knowledge of the plants and other conditions of the primitive world of a hundred and fifty million years ago\u2014the world of the Permian or Triassic age.", "In the course of some months, however, the element of terror did figure with accumulating force.", "This was when the dreams began so unfailingly to have the aspect of memories, and when my mind began to link them with my growing abstract disturbances\u2014the feeling of mnemonic restraint, the curious impressions regarding time, and sense of a loathsome exchange with my secondary personality of 1908-13, and, considerably later, the inexplicable loathing of my own person.", "As certain definite details began to enter the dreams, their horror increased a thousandfold\u2014until by October, 1915, I felt I must do something.", "It was then that I began an intensive study of other cases of amnesia and visions, feeling that I might thereby objectivise my trouble and shake clear of its emotional grip.", "However, as before mentioned, the result was at first almost exactly opposite.", "It disturbed me vastly to find that my dreams had been so closely duplicated; especially since some of the accounts were too early to admit of any geological knowledge\u2014and therefore of any idea of primitive landscapes\u2014on the subjects' part.", "What is more, many of these accounts supplied very horrible details and explanations in connexion with the visions of great buildings and jungle gardens\u2014and other things.", "The actual sights and vague impressions were bad enough, but what was hinted or asserted by some of the other dreamers savored of madness and blasphemy.", "Worst of all, my own pseudo-memory was aroused to wilder dreams and hints of coming revelations.", "And yet most doctors deemed my course, on the whole, an advisable one.", "I studied psychology systematically, and under the prevailing stimulus my son Wingate did the same\u2014his studies leading eventually to his present professorship.", "In 1917 and 1918 I took special courses at Miskatonic.", "Meanwhile, my examination of medical, historical, and anthropological records became indefatigable, involving travels to distant libraries, and finally including even a reading of the hideous books of forbidden elder lore in which my secondary personality had been so disturbingly interested.", "Some of the latter were the actual copies I had consulted in my altered state, and I was greatly disturbed by certain marginal notations and ostensible corrections of the hideous text in a script and idiom which somehow seemed oddly unhuman.", "These markings were mostly in the respective languages of the various books, all of which the writer seemed to know with equal, though obviously academic, facility.", "One note appended to von Junzt'sUnaussprechlichen Kulten, however, was alarmingly otherwise.", "It consisted of certain curvilinear hieroglyphs in the same ink as that of the German corrections, but following no recognized human pattern.", "And these hieroglyphs were closely and unmistakably akin to the characters constantly met with in my dreams\u2014characters whose meaning I would sometimes momentarily fancy I knew, or was just on the brink of recalling.", "To complete my black confusion, my librarians assured me that, in view of previous examinations and records of consultation of the volumes in question, all of these notations must have been made by myself in my secondary state.", "This despite the fact that I was and still am ignorant of three of the languages involved.", "Piecing together the scattered records, ancient and modern, anthropological and medical, I found a fairly consistent mixture of myth and hallucination whose scope and wildness left me utterly dazed.", "Only one thing consoled me, the fact that the myths were of such early existence.", "What lost knowledge could have brought pictures of the Palaeozoic or Mesozoic landscape into these primitive fables, I could not even guess; but the pictures had been there.", "Thus, a basis existed for the formation of a fixed type of delusion.", "Cases of amnesia no doubt created the general myth pattern\u2014but afterward the fanciful accretions of the myths must have reacted on amnesia sufferers and coloured their pseudo-memories.", "I myself had read and heard all the early tales during my memory lapse\u2014my quest had amply proved that.", "Was it not natural, then, for my subsequent dreams and emotional impressions to become coloured and moulded by what my memory subtly held over from my secondary state?", "A few of the myths had significant connexions with other cloudy legends of the pre-human world, especially those Hindu tales involving stupefying gulfs of time and forming part of the lore of modern theosopists.", "Primal myth and modern delusion joined in their assumption that mankind is only one\u2014perhaps the least\u2014of the highly evolved and dominant races of this planet's long and largely unknown career.", "Things of inconceivable shape, they implied, had reared towers to the sky and delved into every secret of Nature before the first amphibian forbear of man had crawled out of the hot sea 300 million years ago.", "Some had come down from the stars; a few were as old as the cosmos itself, others had arisen swiftly from terrene germs as far behind the first germs of our life-cycle as those germs are behind ourselves.", "Spans of thousands of millions of years, and linkages to other galaxies and universes, were freely spoken of.", "Indeed, there was no such thing as time in its humanly accepted sense.", "But most of the tales and impressions concerned a relatively late race, of a queer and intricate shape, resembling no life-form known to science, which had lived till only fifty million years before the advent of man.", "This, they indicated, was the greatest race of all because it alone had conquered the secret of time.", "It had learned all things that ever were known or ever would be known on the earth, through the power of its keener minds to project themselves into the past and future, even through gulfs of millions of years, and study the lore of every age.", "From the accomplishments of this race arose all legends of prophets, including those in human mythology.", "In its vast libraries were volumes of texts and pictures holding the whole of earth's annals\u2014histories and descriptions of every species that had ever been or that ever would be, with full records of their arts, their achievements, their languages, and their psychologies.", "With this aeon-embracing knowledge, the Great Race chose from every era and life-form such thoughts, arts, and processes as might suit its own nature and situation.", "Knowledge of the past, secured through a kind of mind-casting outside the recognized senses, was harder to glean than knowledge of the future.", "In the latter case the course was easier and more material.", "With suitable mechanical aid a mind would project itself forward in time, feeling its dim, extra-sensory way till it approached the desired period.", "Then, after preliminary trials, it would seize on the best discoverable representative of the highest of that period's life-forms.", "It would enter the organism's brain and set up therein its own vibrations, while the displaced mind would strike back to the period of the displacer, remaining in the latter's body till a reverse process was set up.", "The projected mind, in the body of the organism of the future, would then pose as a member of the race whose outward form it wore, learning as quickly as possible all that could be learned of the chosen age and its massed information and techniques.", "Meanwhile the displaced mind, thrown back to the displacer's age and body, would be carefully guarded.", "It would be kept from harming the body it occupied, and would be drained of all its knowledge by trained questioners.", "Often it could be questioned in its own language, when previous quests into the future had brought back records of that language.", "If the mind came from a body whose language the Great Race could not physically reproduce, clever machines would be made, on which the alien speech could be played as on a musical instrument.", "The Great Race's members were immense rugose cones ten feet high, and with head and other organs attached to foot-thick, distensible limbs spreading from the apexes.", "They spoke by the clicking or scraping of huge paws or claws attached to the end of two of their four limbs, and walked by the expansion and contraction of a viscous layer attached to their vast, ten-foot bases.", "When the captive mind's amazement and resentment had worn off, and when\u2014assuming that it came from a body vastly different from the Great Race's\u2014it had lost its horror at its unfamiliar temporary form, it was permitted to study its new environment and experience a wonder and wisdom approximating that of its displacer.", "With suitable precautions, and in exchange for suitable services, it was allowed to rove all over the habitable world in titan airships or on the huge boatlike atomic-engined vehicles which traversed the great roads, and to delve freely into the libraries containing the records of the planet's past and future.", "This reconciled many captive minds to their lot; since none were other than keen, and to such minds the unveiling of hidden mysteries of earth-closed chapters of inconceivable pasts and dizzying vortices of future time which include the years ahead of their own natural ages-forms always, despite the abysmal horrors often unveiled, the supreme experience of life.", "Now and then certain captives were permitted to meet other captive minds seized from the future\u2014to exchange thoughts with consciousnesses living a hundred or a thousand or a million years before or after their own ages.", "And all were urged to write copiously in their own languages of themselves and their respective periods; such documents to be filed in the great central archives.", "It may be added that there was one special type of captive whose privileges were far greater than those of the majority.", "These were the dying permanent exiles, whose bodies in the future had been seized by keen-minded members of the Great Race who, faced with death, sought to escape mental extinction.", "Such melancholy exiles were not as common as might be expected, since the longevity of the Great Race lessened its love of life\u2014especially among those superior minds capable of projection.", "From cases of the permanent projection of elder minds arose many of those lasting changes of personality noticed in later history\u2014including mankind's.", "As for the ordinary cases of exploration\u2014when the displacing mind had learned what it wished in the future, it would build an apparatus like that which had started its flight and reverse the process of projection.", "Once more it would be in its own body in its own age, while the lately captive mind would return to that body of the future to which it properly belonged.", "Only when one or the other of the bodies had died during the exchange was this restoration impossible.", "In such cases, of course, the exploring mind had\u2014like those of the death-escapers\u2014to live out an alien-bodied life in the future; or else the captive mind\u2014like the dying permanent exiles\u2014had to end its days in the form and past age of the Great Race.", "This fate was least horrible when the captive mind was also of the Great Race\u2014a not infrequent occurrence, since in all its periods that race was intensely concerned with its own future.", "The number of dying permanent exiles of the Great Race was very slight\u2014largely because of the tremendous penalties attached to displacements of future Great Race minds by the moribund.", "Through projection, arrangements were made to inflict these penalties on the offending minds in their new future bodies\u2014and sometimes forced re-exchanges were effected.", "Complex cases of the displacement of exploring or already captive minds by minds in various regions of the past had been known and carefully rectified.", "In every age since the discovery of mind projection, a minute but well-recognised element of the population consisted of Great Race minds from past ages, sojourning for a longer or shorter while.", "When a captive mind of alien origin was returned to its own body in the future, it was purged by an intricate mechanical hypnosis of all it had learned in the Great Race's age\u2014this because of certain troublesome consequences inherent in the general carrying forward of knowledge in large quantities.", "The few existing instances of clear transmission had caused, and would cause at known future times, great disasters.", "And it was largely in consequence of two cases of this kind\u2014said the old myths\u2014that mankind had learned what it had concerning the Great Race.", "Of all things surviving physically and directly from that aeon-distant world, there remained only certain ruins of great stones in far places and under the sea, and parts of the text of the frightful Pnakotic Manuscripts.", "Thus the returning mind reached its own age with only the faintest and most fragmentary visions of what it had undergone since its seizure.", "All memories that could be eradicated were eradicated, so that in most cases only a dream-shadowed blank stretched back to the time of the first exchange.", "Some minds recalled more than others, and the chance joining of memories had at rare times brought hints of the forbidden past to future ages.", "There probably never was a time when groups or cults did not secretly cherish certain of these hints.", "In the Necronomicon the presence of such a cult among human beings was suggested\u2014a cult that sometimes gave aid to minds voyaging down the aeons from the days of the Great Race.", "And, meanwhile, the Great Race itself waxed well-nigh omniscient, and turned to the task of setting up exchanges with the minds of other planets, and of exploring their pasts and futures.", "It sought likewise to fathom the past years and origin of that black, aeon-dead orb in far space whence its own mental heritage had come\u2014for the mind of the Great Race was older than its bodily form.", "The beings of a dying elder world, wise with the ultimate secrets, had looked ahead for a new world and species wherein they might have long life; and had sent their minds en masse into that future race best adapted to house them\u2014the cone-shaped beings that peopled our earth a billion years ago.", "Thus the Great Race came to be, while the myriad minds sent backward were left to die in the horror of strange shapes.", "Later the race would again face death, yet would live through another forward migration of its best minds into the bodies of others who had a longer physical span ahead of them.", "Such was the background of intertwined legend and hallucination.", "When, around 1920, I had my researches in coherent shape, I felt a slight lessening of the tension which their earlier stages had increased.", "After all, and in spite of the fancies prompted by blind emotions, were not most of my phenomena readily explainable?", "Any chance might have turned my mind to dark studies during the amnesia\u2014and then I read the forbidden legends and met the members of ancient and ill-regarded cults.", "That, plainly, supplied the material for the dreams and disturbed feelings which came after the return of memory.", "As for the marginal notes in dream-hieroglyphs and languages unknown to me, but laid at my door by librarians\u2014I might easily have picked up a smattering of the tongues during my secondary state, while the hieroglyphs were doubtless coined by my fancy from descriptions in old legends, and afterward woven into my dreams.", "I tried to verify certain points through conversation with known cult leaders, but never succeeded in establishing the right connexions.", "At times the parallelism of so many cases in so many distant ages continued to worry me as it had at first, but on the other hand I reflected that the excitant folklore was undoubtedly more universal in the past than in the present.", "Probably all the other victims whose cases were like mine had had a long and familiar knowledge of the tales I had learned only when in my secondary state.", "When these victims had lost their memory, they had associated themselves with the creatures of their household myths\u2014the fabulous invaders supposed to displace men's minds\u2014and had thus embarked upon quests for knowledge which they thought they could take back to a fancied, non-human past.", "Then, when their memory returned, they reversed the associative process and thought of themselves as the former captive minds instead of as the displacers.", "Hence the dreams and pseudo-memories following the conventional myth pattern.", "Despite the seeming cumbrousness of these explanations, they came finally to supersede all others in my mind\u2014largely because of the greater weakness of any rival theory.", "And a substantial number of eminent psychologists and anthropologists gradually agreed with me.", "The more I reflected, the more convincing did my reasoning seem; till in the end I had a really effective bulwark against the visions and impressions which still assailed me.", "Suppose I did see strange things at night?", "These were only what I had heard and read of.", "Suppose I did have odd loathings and perspectives and pseudo-memories?", "These, too, were only echoes of myths absorbed in my secondary state.", "Nothing that I might dream, nothing that I might feel, could be of any actual significance.", "Fortified by this philosophy, I greatly improved in nervous equilibrium, even though the visions\u2014rather than the abstract impressions\u2014steadily became more frequent and more disturbingly detailed.", "In 1922 I felt able to undertake regular work again, and put my newly gained knowledge to practical use by accepting an instructorship in psychology at the university.", "My old chair of political economy had long been adequately filled\u2014besides which, methods of teaching economics had changed greatly since my heyday.", "My son was at this time just entering on the post-graduate studies leading to his present professorship, and we worked together a great deal.", "I CONTINUED, however, to keep a careful record of the outr\u00e9 dreams which crowded upon me so thickly and vividly.", "Such a record, I argued, was of genuine value as a psychological document.", "The glimpses still seemed damnably like memories, though I fought off this impression with a goodly measure of success.", "In writing, I treated the phantasmata as things seen; but at all other times I brushed them aside like any gossamer illusions of the night.", "I had never mentioned such matters in common conversation; though reports of them, filtering out as such things will, had aroused sundry rumors regarding my mental health.", "It is amusing to reflect that these rumors were confined wholly to laymen, without a single champion among physicians or psychologists.", "Of my visions after 1914 I will here mention only a few, since fuller accounts and records are at the disposal of the serious student.", "It is evident that with time the curious inhibitions somewhat waned, for the scope of my visions vastly increased.", "They have never, though, become other than disjointed fragments seemingly without clear motivation.", "Within the dreams I seemed gradually to acquire a greater and greater freedom of wandering.", "I floated through many strange buildings of stone, going from one to the other along mammoth underground passages which seemed to form the common avenues of transit.", "Sometimes I encountered those gigantic sealed trap-doors in the lowest level, around which such an aura of fear and forbiddenness clung.", "I saw tremendously tessellated pools, and rooms of curious and inexplicable utensils of myriad sorts.", "Then there were colossal caverns of intricate machinery whose outlines and purpose were wholly strange to me, and whose sound manifested itself only after many years of dreaming.", "I may here remark that sight and sound are the only senses I have ever exercised in the visionary world.", "The real horror began in May, 1915, when I first saw the living things.", "This was before my studies had taught me what, in view of the myths and case histories, to expect.", "As mental barriers wore down, I beheld great masses of thin vapour in various parts of the building and in the streets below.", "These steadily grew more solid and distinct, till at last I could trace their monstrous outlines with uncomfortable ease.", "They seemed to be enormous, iridescent cones, about ten feet high and ten feet wide at the base, and made up of some ridgy, scaly, semi-elastic matter.", "From their apexes projected four flexible, cylindrical members, each a foot thick, and of a ridgy substance like that of the cones themselves.", "These members were sometimes contracted almost to nothing, and sometimes extended to any distance up to about ten feet.", "Terminating two of them were enormous claws or nippers.", "At the end of a third were four red, trumpetlike appendages.", "The fourth terminated in an irregular yellowish globe some two feet in diameter and having three great dark eyes ranged along its central circumference.", "Surmounting this head were four slender grey stalks bearing flower-like appendages, whilst from its nether side dangled eight greenish antennae or tentacles.", "The great base of the central cone was fringed with a rubbery, grey substance which moved the whole entity through expansion and contraction.", "Their actions, though harmless, horrified me even more than their appearance\u2014for it is not wholesome to watch monstrous objects doing what one had known only human beings to do.", "These objects moved intelligently about the great rooms, getting books from the shelves and taking them to the great tables, or vice versa, and sometimes writing diligently with a peculiar rod gripped in the greenish head tentacles.", "The huge nippers were used in carrying books and in conversation-speech consisting of a kind of clicking and scraping.", "The objects had no clothing, but wore satchels or knapsacks suspended from the top of the conical trunk.", "They commonly carried their head and its supporting member at the level of the cone top, although it was frequently raised or lowered.", "The other three great members tended to rest downward at the sides of the cone, contracted to about five feet each when not in use.", "From their rate of reading, writing, and operating their machines\u2014those on the tables seemed somehow connected with thought\u2014I concluded that their intelligence was enormously greater than man's.", "Afterward I saw them everywhere; swarming in all the great chambers and corridors, tending monstrous machines in vaulted crypts, and racing along the vast roads in gigantic, boat-shaped cars.", "I ceased to be afraid of them, for they seemed to form supremely natural parts of their environment.", "Individual differences amongst them began to be manifest, and a few appeared to be under some kind of restraint.", "These latter, though shewing no physical variation, had a diversity of gestures and habits which marked them off not only from the majority, but very largely from one another.", "They wrote a great deal in what seemed to my cloudy vision a vast variety of characters\u2014never the typical curvilinear hieroglyphs of the majority.", "A few, I fancied, used our own familiar alphabet.", "Most of them worked much more slowly than the general mass of the entities.", "All this time my own part in the dreams seemed to be that of a disembodied consciousness with a range of vision wider than the normal, floating freely about, yet confined to the ordinary avenues and speeds of travel.", "Not until August, 1915, did any suggestions of bodily existence begin to harass me.", "I say harass, because the first phase was a purely abstract, though infinitely terrible, association of my previously noted body loathing with the scenes of my visions.", "For a while my chief concern during dreams was to avoid looking down at myself, and I recall how grateful I was for the total absence of large mirrors in the strange rooms.", "I was mightily troubled by the fact that I always saw the great tables\u2014whose height could not be under ten feet\u2014from a level not below that of their surfaces.", "And then the morbid temptation to look down at myself became greater and greater, till one night I could not resist it.", "At first my downward glance revealed nothing whatever.", "A moment later I perceived that this was because my head lay at the end of a flexible neck of enormous length.", "Retracting this neck and gazing down very sharply, I saw the scaly, rugose, iridescent bulk of a vast cone ten feet tall and ten feet wide at the base.", "That was when I waked half of Arkham with my screaming as I plunged madly up from the abyss of sleep.", "Only after weeks of hideous repetition did I grow half-reconciled to these visions of myself in monstrous form.", "In the dreams I now moved bodily among the other unknown entities, reading terrible books from the endless shelves and writing for hours at the great tables with a stylus managed by the green tentacles that hung down from my head.", "Snatches of what I read and wrote would linger in my memory.", "There were horrible annals of other worlds and other universes, and of stirrings of formless life outside of all universes.", "There were records of strange orders of beings which had peopled the world in forgotten pasts, and frightful chronicles of grotesque-bodied intelligences which would people it millions of years after the death of the last human being.", "I learned of chapters in human history whose existence no scholar of today has ever suspected.", "Most of these writings were in the language of the hieroglyphs; which I studied in a queer way with the aid of droning machines, and which was evidently an agglutinative speech with root systems utterly unlike any found in human languages.", "Other volumes were in other unknown tongues learned in the same queer way.", "A very few were in languages I knew.", "Extremely clever pictures, both inserted in the records and forming separate collections, aided me immensely.", "And all the time I seemed to be setting down a history of my own age in English.", "On waking, I could recall only minute and meaningless scraps of the unknown tongues which my dream-self had mastered, though whole phrases of the history stayed with me.", "I learned\u2014even before my waking self had studied the parallel cases or the old myths from which the dreams doubtless sprang\u2014that the entities around me were of the world's greatest race, which had conquered time and had sent exploring minds into every age.", "I knew, too, that I had been snatched from my age while another used my body in that age, and that a few of the other strange forms housed similarly captured minds.", "I seemed to talk, in some odd language of claw clickings, with exiled intellects from every corner of the solar system.", "There was a mind from the planet we know as Venus, which would live incalculable epochs to come, and one from an outer moon of Jupiter six million years in the past.", "Of earthly minds there were some from the winged, star-headed, half-vegetable race of palaeogean Antarctica; one from the reptile people of fabled Valusia; three from the furry pre-human Hyperborean worshippers of Tsathoggua; one from the wholly abominable Tcho-Tchos; two from the arachnid denizens of earth's last age; five from the hardy coleopterous species immediately following mankind, to which the Great Race was some day to transfer its keenest minds en masse in the face of horrible peril; and several from different branches of humanity.", "I talked with the mind of Yiang-Li, a philosopher from the cruel empire of Tsan-Chan, which is to come in 5,000 A.D.; with that of a general of the greatheaded brown people who held South Africa in 50,000 B.C.", "; with that of a twelfth-century Florentine monk named Bartolomeo Corsi; with that of a king of Lomar who had ruled that terrible polar land one hundred thousand years before the squat, yellow Inutos came from the west to engulf it.", "I talked with the mind of Nug-Soth, a magician of the dark conquerors of 16,000 A.D.; with that of a Roman named Titus Sempronius Blaesus, who had been a quaestor in Sulla's time; with that of Khephnes, an Egyptian of the 14th Dynasty, who told me the hideous secret of Nyarlathotep, with that of a priest of Atlantis' middle kingdom; with that of a Suffolk gentleman of Cromwell's day, James Woodville; with that of a court astronomer of pre-Inca Peru; with that of the Australian physicist Nevil Kingston-Brown, who will die in 2,518 A.D.; with that of an archimage of vanished Yhe in the Pacific; with that of Theodotides, a Greco-Bactrian official of 200 B.C.", "; with that of an aged Frenchman of Louis XIII's time named Pierre-Louis Montagny; with that of Crom-Ya, a Cimmerian chieftain of 15,000 B.C.", "; and with so many others that my brain cannot hold the shocking secrets and dizzying marvels I learned from them.", "I awaked each morning in a fever, sometimes frantically trying to verify or discredit such information as fell within the range of modern human knowledge.", "Traditional facts took on new and doubtful aspects, and I marvelled at the dream-fancy which could invent such surprising addenda to history and science.", "I shivered at the mysteries the past may conceal, and trembled at the menaces the future may bring forth.", "What was hinted in the speech of post-human entities of the fate of mankind produced such an effect on me that I will not set it down here.", "After man there would be the mighty beetle civilisation, the bodies of whose members the cream of the Great Race would seize when the monstrous doom overtook the elder world.", "Later, as the earth's span closed, the transferred minds would again migrate through time and space\u2014to another stopping-place in the bodies of the bulbous vegetable entities of Mercury.", "But there would be races after them, clinging pathetically to the cold planet and burrowing to its horror-filled core, before the utter end.", "Meanwhile, in my dreams, I wrote endlessly in that history of my own age which I was preparing\u2014half voluntarily and half through promises of increased library and travel opportunities\u2014for the Great Race's central archives.", "The archives were in a colossal subterranean structure near the city's center, which I came to know well through frequent labors and consultations.", "Meant to last as long as the race, and to withstand the fiercest of earth's convulsions, this titan repository surpassed all other buildings in the massive, mountain-like firmness of its construction.", "The records, written or printed on great sheets of a curiously tenacious cellulose fabric were bound into books that opened from the top, and were kept in individual cases of a strange, extremely light, rustless metal of greyish hue, decorated with mathematical designs and bearing the title in the Great Race's curvilinear hieroglyphs.", "These cases were stored in tiers of rectangular vaults\u2014like closed, locked shelves\u2014wrought of the same rustless metal and fastened by knobs with intricate turnings.", "My own history was assigned a specific place in the vaults of the lowest or vertebrate level\u2014the section devoted to the culture of mankind and of the furry and reptilian races immediately preceding it in terrestrial dominance.", "But none of the dreams ever gave me a full picture of daily life.", "All were the merest misty, disconnected fragments, and it is certain that these fragments were not unfolded in their rightful sequence.", "I have, for example, a very imperfect idea of my own living arrangements in the dream-world; though I seem to have possessed a great stone room of my own.", "My restrictions as a prisoner gradually disappeared, so that some of the visions included vivid travels over the mighty jungle roads, sojourns in strange cities, and explorations of some of the vast, dark, windowless ruins from which the Great Race shrank in curious fear.", "There were also long sea voyages in enormous, many-decked boats of incredible swiftness, and trips over wild regions in closed projectile-like airships lifted and moved by electrical repulsion.", "Beyond the wide, warm ocean were other cities of the Great Race, and on one far continent I saw the crude villages of the black-snouted, winged creatures who would evolve as a dominant stock after the Great Race had sent its foremost minds into the future to escape the creeping horror.", "Flatness and exuberant green life were always the keynote of the scene.", "Hills were low and sparse, and usually displayed signs of volcanic forces.", "Of the animals I saw, I could write volumes.", "All were wild; for the Great Race's mechanised culture had long since done away with domestic beasts, while food was wholly vegetable or synthetic.", "Clumsy reptiles of great bulk floundered in steaming morasses, fluttered in the heavy air, or spouted in the seas and lakes; and among these I fancied I could vaguely recognise lesser, archaic prototypes of many forms\u2014dinosaurs, pterodactyls, ichthyosaurs, labyrinthodonts, plesiosaurs, and the like-made familiar through palaeontology.", "Of birds or mammals there were none that I could discover.", "The ground and swamps were constantly alive with snakes, lizards, and crocodiles while insects buzzed incessantly among the lush vegetation.", "And far out at sea, unspied and unknown monsters spouted mountainous columns of foam into the vaporous sky.", "Once I was taken under the ocean in a gigantic submarine vessel with searchlights, and glimpsed some living horrors of awesome magnitude.", "I saw also the ruins of incredible sunken cities, and the wealth of crinoid, brachiopod, coral, and ichthyic life which everywhere abounded.", "Of the physiology, psychology, folkways, and detailed history of the Great Race my visions preserved but little information, and many of the scattered points I here set down were gleaned from my study of old legends and other cases rather than from my own dreaming.", "For in time, of course, my reading and research caught up with and passed the dreams in many phases, so that certain dream-fragments were explained in advance and formed verifications of what I had learned.", "This consolingly established my belief that similar reading and research, accomplished by my secondary self, had formed the source of the whole terrible fabric of pseudomemories.", "The period of my dreams, apparently, was one somewhat less than 150,000,000 years ago, when the Palaeozoic age was giving place to the Mesozoic.", "The bodies occupied by the Great Race represented no surviving\u2014or even scientifically known\u2014line of terrestrial evolution, but were of a peculiar, closely homogeneous, and highly specialised organic type inclining as much as to the vegetable as to the animal state.", "Cell action was of an unique sort almost precluding fatigue, and wholly eliminating the need of sleep.", "Nourishment, assimilated through the red trumpet-like appendages on one of the great flexible limbs, was always semi-fluid and in many aspects wholly unlike the food of existing animals.", "The beings had but two of the senses which we recognise\u2014sight and hearing, the latter accomplished through the flower-like appendages on the grey stalks above their heads.", "Of other and incomprehensible senses\u2014not, however, well utilizable by alien captive minds inhabiting their bodies\u2014they possessed many.", "Their three eyes were so situated as to give them a range of vision wider than the normal.", "Their blood was a sort of deep-greenish ichor of great thickness.", "They had no sex, but reproduced through seeds or spores which clustered on their bases and could be developed only under water.", "Great, shallow tanks were used for the growth of their young\u2014which were, however, reared only in small numbers on account of the longevity of individuals\u2014four or five thousand years being the common life span.", "Markedly defective individuals were quickly disposed of as soon as their defects were noticed.", "Disease and the approach of death were, in the absence of a sense of touch or of physical pain, recognised by purely visual symptoms.", "The dead were incinerated with dignified ceremonies.", "Once in a while, as before mentioned, a keen mind would escape death by forward projection in time; but such cases were not numerous.", "When one did occur, the exiled mind from the future was treated with the utmost kindness till the dissolution of its unfamiliar tenement.", "The Great Race seemed to form a single, loosely knit nation or league, with major institutions in common, though there were four definite divisions.", "The political and economic system of each unit was a sort of fascistic socialism, with major resources rationally distributed, and power delegated to a small governing board elected by the votes of all able to pass certain educational and psychological tests.", "Family organisation was not overstressed, though ties among persons of common descent were recognised, and the young were generally reared by their parents.", "Resemblances to human attitudes and institutions were, of course, most marked in those fields where on the one hand highly abstract elements were concerned, or where on the other hand there was a dominance of the basic, unspecialised urges common to all organic life.", "A few added likenesses came through conscious adoption as the Great Race probed the future and copied what it liked.", "Industry, highly mechanised, demanded but little time from each citizen; and the abundant leisure was filled with intellectual and aesthetic activities of various sorts.", "The sciences were carried to an unbelievable height of development, and art was a vital part of life, though at the period of my dreams it had passed its crest and meridian.", "Technology was enormously stimulated through the constant struggle to survive, and to keep in existence the physical fabric of great cities, imposed by the prodigious geologic upheavals of those primal days.", "Crime was surprisingly scant, and was dealt with through highly efficient policing.", "Punishments ranged from privilege deprivation and imprisonment to death or major emotion wrenching, and were never administered without a careful study of the criminal's motivations.", "Warfare, largely civil for the last few millennia though sometimes waged against reptilian or octopodic invaders, or against the winged, star-headed Old Ones who centered in the antarctic, was infrequent though infinitely devastating.", "An enormous army, using camera-like weapons which produced tremendous electrical effects, was kept on hand for purposes seldom mentioned, but obviously connected with the ceaseless fear of the dark, windowless elder ruins and of the great sealed trap-doors in the lowest subterranean levels.", "This fear of the basalt ruins and trap-doors was largely a matter of unspoken suggestion\u2014or, at most, of furtive quasi-whispers.", "Everything specific which bore on it was significantly absent from such books as were on the common shelves.", "It was the one subject lying altogether under a taboo among the Great Race, and seemed to be connected alike with horrible bygone struggles, and with that future peril which would some day force the race to send its keener minds ahead en masse in time.", "Imperfect and fragmentary as were the other things presented by dreams and legends, this matter was still more bafflingly shrouded.", "The vague old myths avoided it\u2014or perhaps all allusions had for some reason been excised.", "And in the dreams of myself and others, the hints were peculiarly few.", "Members of the Great Race never intentionally referred to the matter, and what could be gleaned came only from some of the more sharply observant captive minds.", "According to these scraps of information, the basis of the fear was a horrible elder race of half-polypous, utterly alien entities which had come through space from immeasurably distant universes and had dominated the earth and three other solar planets about 600 million years ago.", "They were only partly material\u2014as we understand matter\u2014and their type of consciousness and media of perception differed widely from those of terrestrial organisms.", "For example, their senses did not include that of sight; their mental world being a strange, non-visual pattern of impressions.", "They were, however, sufficiently material to use implements of normal matter when in cosmic areas containing it; and they required housing\u2014albeit of a peculiar kind.", "Though their senses could penetrate all material barriers, their substance could not; and certain forms of electrical energy could wholly destroy them.", "They had the power of a\u00ebrial motion, despite the absence of wings or any other visible means of levitation.", "Their minds were of such texture that no exchange with them could be effected by the Great Race.", "When these things had come to the earth they had built mighty basalt cities of windowless towers, and had preyed horribly upon the beings they found.", "Thus it was when the minds of the Great Race sped across the void from that obscure, trans-galactic world known in the disturbing and debatable Eltdown Shards as Yith.", "The newcomers, with the instruments they created, had found it easy to subdue the predatory entities and drive them down to those caverns of inner earth which they had already joined to their abodes and begun to inhabit.", "Then they had sealed the entrances and left them to their fate, afterward occupying most of their great cities and preserving certain important buildings for reasons connected more with superstition than with indifference, boldness, or scientific and historical zeal.", "But as the aeons passed there came vague, evil signs that the elder things were growing strong and numerous in the inner world.", "There were sporadic irruptions of a particularly hideous character in certain small and remote cities of the Great Race, and in some of the deserted elder cities which the Great Race had not peopled\u2014places where the paths to the gulfs below had not been properly sealed or guarded.", "After that greater precautions were taken, and many of the paths were closed forever\u2014though a few were left with sealed trap-doors for strategic use in fighting the elder things if ever they broke forth in unexpected places.", "The irruptions of the elder things must have been shocking beyond all description, since they had permanently coloured the psychology of the Great Race.", "Such was the fixed mood of horror that the very aspect of the creatures was left unmentioned.", "At no time was I able to gain a clear hint of what they looked like.", "There were veiled suggestions of a monstrous plasticity, and of temporary lapses of visibility, while other fragmentary whispers referred to their control and military use of great winds.", "Singular whistling noises, and colossal footprints made up of five circular toe marks, seemed also to be associated with them.", "It was evident that the coming doom so desperately feared by the Great Race\u2014the doom that was one day to send millions of keen minds across the chasm of time to strange bodies in the safer future\u2014had to do with a final successful irruption of the elder beings.", "Mental projections down the ages had clearly foretold such a horror, and the Great Race had resolved that none who could escape should face it.", "That the foray would be a matter of vengeance, rather than an attempt to reoccupy the outer world, they knew from the planet's later history\u2014for their projections shewed the coming and going of subsequent races untroubled by the monstrous entities.", "Perhaps these entities had come to prefer earth's inner abysses to the variable, storm-ravaged surface, since light meant nothing to them.", "Perhaps, too, they were slowly weakening with the aeons.", "Indeed, it was known that they would be quite dead in the time of the post-human beetle race which the fleeing minds would tenant.", "Meanwhile, the Great Race maintained its cautious vigilance, with potent weapons ceaselessly ready despite the horrified banishing of the subject from common speech and visible records.", "And always the shadow of nameless fear hung bout the sealed trap-doors and the dark, windowless elder towers.", "THAT is the world of which my dreams brought me dim, scattered echoes every night.", "I cannot hope to give any true idea of the horror and dread contained in such echoes, for it was upon a wholly intangible quality\u2014the sharp sense of pseudo-memory\u2014that such feelings mainly depended.", "As I have said, my studies gradually gave me a defence against these feelings in the form of rational psychological explanations; and this saving influence was augmented by the subtle touch of accustomedness which comes with the passage of time.", "Yet in spite of everything the vague, creeping terror would return momentarily now and then.", "It did not, however, engulf me as it had before; and after 1922 I lived a very normal life of work and recreation.", "In the course of years I began to feel that my experience\u2014together with the kindred cases and the related folklore\u2014ought to be definitely summarised and published for the benefit of serious students; hence I prepared a series of articles briefly covering the whole ground and illustrated with crude sketches of some of the shapes, scenes, decorative motifs, and hieroglyphs remembered from the dreams.", "These appeared at various times during 1928 and 1929 in the Journal of the American Psychological Society, but did not attract much attention.", "Meanwhile I continued to record my dreams with the minutest care, even though the growing stack of reports attained troublesomely vast proportions.", "On July 10, 1934, there was forwarded to me by the Psychological Society the letter which opened the culminating and most horrible phase of the whole mad ordeal.", "It was postmarked Pilbarra, Western Australia, and bore the signature of one whom I found, upon inquiry, to be a mining engineer of considerable prominence.", "Enclosed were some very curious snapshots.", "I will reproduce the text in its entirety, and no reader can fail to understand how tremendous an effect it and the photographs had upon me.", "I was, for a time, almost stunned and incredulous; for although I had often thought that some basis of fact must underlie certain phases of the legends which had coloured my dreams, I was none the less unprepared for anything like a tangible survival from a lost world remote beyond all imagination.", "Most devastating of all were the photographs\u2014for here, in cold, incontrovertible realism, there stood out against a background of sand certain worn-down, water-ridged, storm-weathered blocks of stone whose slightly convex tops and slightly concave bottoms told their own story.", "And when I studied them with a magnifying glass I could see all too plainly, amidst the batterings and pittings, the traces of those vast curvilinear designs and occasional hieroglyphs whose significance had become so hideous to me.", "But here is the letter, which speaks for itself.", "49, Dampier St.,\n\nPilbarra, W. Australia,\n\nMay 18, 1934.", "Prof. N. W Peaslee,\n\nc/o Am.", "Psychological Society,\n\n30 E. 41st St.,\n\nNew York City, U.S.A.\n\n\tMy Dear Sir:\u2014\n\n\tA recent conversation with Dr. E. M. Boyle of Perth, and some papers with your articles which he has just sent me, make it advisable for me to tell you about certain things I have seen in the Great Sandy Desert east of our gold field here.", "It would seem, in view of the peculiar legends about old cities with huge stonework and strange designs and hieroglyphs which you describe, that I have come upon something very important.", "The blackfellows have always been full of talk about \"great stones with marks on them,\" and seem to have a terrible fear of such things.", "They connect them in some way with their common racial legends about Buddai, the gigantic old man who lies asleep for ages underground with his head on his arm, and who will some day awake and eat up the world.", "There are some very old and half-forgotten tales of enormous underground huts of great stones, where passages lead down and down, and where horrible things have happened.", "The blackfellows claim that once some warriors, fleeing in battle, went down into one and never came back, but that frightful winds began to blow from the place soon after they went down.", "However, there usually isn't much in what these natives say.", "But what I have to tell is more than this.", "Two years ago, when I was prospecting about 500 miles east in the desert, I came on a lot of queer pieces of dressed stone perhaps 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2 feet in size, and weathered and pitted to the very limit.", "At first I couldn't find any of the marks the blackfellows told about, but when I looked close enough I could make out some deeply carved lines in spite of the weathering.", "There were peculiar curves, just like what the blackfellows had tried to describe.", "I imagine there must have been thirty or forty blocks, some nearly buried in the sand, and all within a circle perhaps a quarter of a mile in diameter.", "When I saw some, I looked around closely for more, and made a careful reckoning of the place with my instruments.", "I also took pictures of ten or twelve of the most typical blocks, and will enclose the prints for you to see.", "I turned my information and pictures over to the government at Perth, but they have done nothing about them.", "Then I met Dr. Boyle, who had read your articles in the Journal of the American Psychological Society, and, in time, happened to mention the stones.", "He was enormously interested, and became quite excited when I shewed him my snapshots, saying that the stones and the markings were just like those of the masonry you had dreamed about and seen described in legends.", "He meant to write you, but was delayed.", "Meanwhile, he sent me most of the magazines with your articles, and I saw at once, from your drawings and descriptions, that my stones are certainly the kind you mean.", "You can appreciate this from the enclosed prints.", "Later on you will hear directly from Dr. Boyle.", "Now I can understand how important all this will be to you.", "Without question we are faced with the remains of an unknown civilization older than any dreamed of before, and forming a basis for your legends.", "As a mining engineer, I have some knowledge of geology, and can tell you that these blocks are so ancient they frighten me.", "They are mostly sandstone and granite, though one is almost certainly made of a queer sort of cement or concrete.", "They bear evidence of water action, as if this part of the world had been submerged and come up again after long ages\u2014all since those blocks were made and used.", "It is a matter of hundreds of thousands of years\u2014or heaven knows how much more.", "I don't like to think about it.", "In view of your previous diligent work in tracking down the legends and everything connected with them, I cannot doubt but that you will want to lead an expedition to the desert and make some archaeological excavations.", "Both Dr. Boyle and I are prepared to cooperate in such work if you\u2014or organizations known to you\u2014can furnish the funds.", "I can get together a dozen miners for the heavy digging\u2014the blackfellows would be of no use, for I've found that they have an almost maniacal fear of this particular spot.", "Boyle and I are saying nothing to others, for you very obviously ought to have precedence in any discoveries or credit.", "The place can be reached from Pilbarra in about four days by motor tractor\u2014which we'd need for our apparatus.", "It is somewhat west and south of Warburton's path of 1873, and 100 miles southeast of Joanna Spring.", "We could float things up the De Grey River instead of starting from Pilbarra\u2014but all that can be talked over later.", "Roughly the stones lie at a point about 22\u00b0 3' 14\" South Latitude, 125\u00b0 0' 39\" East Longitude.", "The climate is tropical, and the desert conditions are trying.", "I shall welcome further correspondence upon this subject, and am keenly eager to assist in any plan you may devise.", "After studying your articles I am deeply impressed with the profound significance of the whole matter.", "Dr. Boyle will write later.", "When rapid communication is needed, a cable to Perth can be relayed by wireless.", "Hoping profoundly for an early message,\n\n\tBelieve me,\n\n\tMost faithfully yours,\n\n\tRobert B. F. Mackenzie\n\n\tOf the immediate aftermath of this letter, much can be learned from the press.", "My good fortune in securing the backing of Miskatonic University was great, and both Mr. Mackenzie and Dr. Boyle proved invaluable in arranging matters at the Australian end.", "We were not too specific with the public about our objects, since the whole matter would have lent itself unpleasantly to sensational and jocose treatment by the cheaper newspapers.", "As a result, printed reports were sparing; but enough appeared to tell of our quest for reported Australian ruins and to chronicle our various preparatory steps.", "Professor William Dyer of the college's geology department\u2014leader of the Miskatonic Antarctic Expedition Of 1930-31\u2014Ferdinand C. Ashley of the department of ancient history, and Tyler M. Freeborn of the department of anthropology\u2014together with my son Wingate\u2014accompanied me.", "My correspondent, Mackenzie, came to Arkham early in 1935 and assisted in our final preparations.", "He proved to be a tremendously competent and affable man of about fifty, admirably well-read, and deeply familiar with all the conditions of Australian travel.", "He had tractors waiting at Pilbarra, and we chartered a tramp steamer sufficiently small to get up the river to that point.", "We were prepared to excavate in the most careful and scientific fashion, sifting every particle of sand, and disturbing nothing which might seem to be in or near its original situation.", "Sailing from Boston aboard the wheezy Lexington on March 28, 1935, we had a leisurely trip across the Atlantic and Mediterranean, through the Suez Canal, down the Red Sea, and across the Indian Ocean to our goal.", "I need not tell how the sight of the low, sandy West Australian coast depressed me, and how I detested the crude mining town and dreary gold fields where the tractors were given their last loads.", "Dr. Boyle, who met us, proved to be elderly, pleasant, and intelligent\u2014and his knowledge of psychology led him into many long discussions with my son and me.", "Discomfort and expectancy were oddly mingled in most of us when at length our party of eighteen rattled forth over the arid leagues of sand and rock.", "On Friday, May 31st, we forded a branch of the De Grey and entered the realm of utter desolation.", "A certain positive terror grew on me as we advanced to this actual site of the elder world behind the legends\u2014a terror, of course, abetted by the fact that my disturbing dreams and pseudo-memories still beset me with unabated force.", "It was on Monday, June 3rd, that we saw the first of the half-buried blocks.", "I cannot describe the emotions with which I actually touched\u2014in objective reality\u2014a fragment of Cyclopean masonry in every respect like the blocks in the walls of my dream-buildings.", "There was a distinct trace of carving\u2014and my hands trembled as I recognised part of a curvilinear decorative scheme made hellish to me through years of tormenting nightmare and baffling research.", "A month of digging brought a total of some 1250 blocks in varying stages of wear and disintegration.", "Most of these were carven megaliths with curved tops and bottoms.", "A minority were smaller, flatter, plain-surfaced, and square or octagonally cut-like those of the floors and pavements in my dreams\u2014while a few were singularly massive and curved or slanted in such a manner as to suggest use in vaulting or groining, or as parts of arches or round window casings.", "The deeper\u2014and the farther north and east\u2014we dug, the more blocks we found; though we still failed to discover any trace of arrangement among them.", "Professor Dyer was appalled at the measureless age of the fragments, and Freeborn found traces of symbols which fitted darkly into certain Papuan and Polynesian legends of infinite antiquity.", "The condition and scattering of the blocks told mutely of vertiginous cycles of time and geologic upheavals of cosmic savagery.", "We had an a\u00ebroplane with us, and my son Wingate would often go up to different heights and scan the sand-and-rock waste for signs of dim, large-scale outlines\u2014either differences of level or trails of scattered blocks.", "His results were virtually negative; for whenever he would one day think he had glimpsed some significant trend, he would on his next trip find the impression replaced by another equally insubstantial\u2014a result of the shifting, wind-blown sand.", "One or two of these ephemeral suggestions, though, affected me queerly and disagreeably.", "They seemed, after a fashion, to dovetail horribly with something I had dreamed or read, but which I could no longer remember.", "There was a terrible familiarity about them\u2014which somehow made me look furtively and apprehensively over the abominable, sterile terrain toward the north and northeast.", "Around the first week in July I developed an unaccountable set of mixed emotions about that general northeasterly region.", "There was horror, and there was curiosity\u2014but more than that, there was a persistent and perplexing illusion of memory.", "I tried all sorts of psychological expedients to get these notions out of my head, but met with no success.", "Sleeplessness also gained upon me, but I almost welcomed this because of the resultant shortening of my dream-periods.", "I acquired the habit of taking long, lone walks in the desert late at night\u2014usually to the north or northeast, whither the sum of my strange new impulses seemed subtly to pull me.", "Sometimes, on these walks, I would stumble over nearly buried fragments of the ancient masonry.", "Though there were fewer visible blocks here than where we had started, I felt sure that there must be a vast abundance beneath the surface.", "The ground was less level than at our camp, and the prevailing high winds now and then piled the sand into fantastic temporary hillocks\u2014exposing low traces of the elder stones while it covered other traces.", "I was queerly anxious to have the excavations extend to this territory, yet at the same time dreaded what might be revealed.", "Obviously, I was getting into a rather bad state\u2014all the worse because I could not account for it.", "An indication of my poor nervous health can be gained from my response to an odd discovery which I made on one of my nocturnal rambles.", "It was on the evening of July 11th, when the moon flooded the mysterious hillocks with a curious pallor.", "Wandering somewhat beyond my usual limits, I came upon a great stone which seemed to differ markedly from any we had yet encountered.", "It was almost wholly covered, but I stooped and cleared away the sand with my hands, later studying the object carefully and supplementing the moonlight with my electric torch.", "Unlike the other very large rocks, this one was perfectly square-cut, with no convex or concave surface.", "It seemed, too, to be of a dark basaltic substance, wholly dissimilar to the granite and sandstone and occasional concrete of the now familiar fragments.", "Suddenly I rose, turned, and ran for the camp at top speed.", "It was a wholly unconscious and irrational flight, and only when I was close to my tent did I fully realise why I had run.", "Then it came to me.", "The queer dark stone was something which I had dreamed and read about, and which was linked with the uttermost horrors of the aeon-old legendry.", "It was one of the blocks of that basaltic elder masonry which the fabled Great Race held in such fear\u2014the tall, windowless ruins left by those brooding, half-material, alien things that festered in earth's nether abysses and against whose wind-like, invisible forces the trap-doors were sealed and the sleepless sentinels posted.", "I remained awake all night, but by dawn realised how silly I had been to let the shadow of a myth upset me.", "Instead of being frightened, I should have had a discoverer's enthusiasm.", "The next forenoon I told the others about my find, and Dyer, Freeborn, Boyle, my son, and I set out to view the anomalous block.", "Failure, however, confronted us.", "I had formed no clear idea of the stone's location, and a late wind had wholly altered the hillocks of shifting sand.", "I COME now to the crucial and most difficult part of my narrative\u2014all the more difficult because I cannot be quite certain of its reality.", "At times I feel uncomfortably sure that I was not dreaming or deluded; and it is this feeling in view of the stupendous implications which the objective truth of my experience would raise\u2014which impels me to make this record.", "My son\u2014a trained psychologist with the fullest and most sympathetic knowledge of my whole case\u2014shall be the primary judge of what I have to tell.", "First let me outline the externals of the matter, as those at the camp know them.", "On the night of July 17-18, after a windy day, I retired early but could not sleep.", "Rising shortly before eleven, and afflicted as usual with that strange feeling regarding the northeastward terrain, I set out on one of my typical nocturnal walks; seeing and greeting only one person\u2014an Australian miner named Tupper\u2014as I left our precincts.", "The moon, slightly past full, shone from a clear sky, and drenched the ancient sands with a white, leprous radiance which seemed to me somehow infinitely evil.", "There was no longer any wind, nor did any return for nearly five hours, as amply attested by Tupper and others who saw me walking rapidly across the pallid, secret-guarding hillocks toward the northeast.", "About 3:30 a.m. a violent wind blew up, waking everyone in camp and felling three of the tents.", "The sky was unclouded, and the desert still blazed with that leprous moonlight.", "As the party saw to the tents my absence was noted, but in view of my previous walks this circumstance gave no one alarm.", "And yet, as many as three men\u2014all Australians\u2014seemed to feel something sinister in the air.", "Mackenzie explained to Professor Freeborn that this was a fear picked up from blackfellow folklore\u2014the natives having woven a curious fabric of malignant myth about the high winds which at long intervals sweep across the sands under a clear sky.", "Such winds, it is whispered, blow out of the great stone huts under the ground, where terrible things have happened\u2014and are never felt except near places where the big marked stones are scattered.", "Close to four the gale subsided as suddenly as it had begun, leaving the sand hills in new and unfamiliar shapes.", "It was just past five, with the bloated, fungoid moon sinking in the west, when I staggered into camp\u2014hatless, tattered, features scratched and ensanguined, and without my electric torch.", "Most of the men had returned to bed, but Professor Dyer was smoking a pipe in front of his tent.", "Seeing my winded and almost frenzied state, he called Dr. Boyle, and the two of them got me on my cot and made me comfortable.", "My son, roused by the stir, soon joined them, and they all tried to force me to lie still and attempt sleep.", "But there was no sleep for me.", "My psychological state was very extraordinary\u2014different from anything I had previously suffered.", "After a time I insisted upon talking\u2014nervously and elaborately explaining my condition.", "I told them I had become fatigued, and had lain down in the sand for a nap.", "There had, I said, been dreams even more frightful than usual\u2014and when I was awaked by the sudden high wind my overwrought nerves had snapped.", "I had fled in panic, frequently falling over half-buried stones and thus gaining my tattered and bedraggled aspect.", "I must have slept long\u2014hence the hours of my absence.", "Of anything strange either seen or experienced I hinted absolutely nothing\u2014exercising the greatest self-control in that respect.", "But I spoke of a change of mind regarding the whole work of the expedition, and urged a halt in all digging toward the northeast.", "My reasoning was patently weak\u2014for I mentioned a dearth of blocks, a wish not to offend the superstitious miners, a possible shortage of funds from the college, and other things either untrue or irrelevant.", "Naturally, no one paid the least attention to my new wishes\u2014not even my son, whose concern for my health was obvious.", "The next day I was up and around the camp, but took no part in the excavations.", "Seeing that I could not stop the work, I decided to return home as soon as possible for the sake of my nerves, and made my son promise to fly me in the plane to Perth\u2014a thousand miles to the southwest\u2014as soon as he had surveyed the region I wished let alone.", "If, I reflected, the thing I had seen was still visible, I might decide to attempt a specific warning even at the cost of ridicule.", "It was just conceivable that the miners who knew the local folklore might back me up.", "Humouring me, my son made the survey that very afternoon, flying over all the terrain my walk could possibly have covered.", "Yet nothing of what I had found remained in sight.", "It was the case of the anomalous basalt block all over again\u2014the shifting sand had wiped out every trace.", "For an instant I half regretted having lost a certain awesome object in my stark fright\u2014but now I know that the loss was merciful.", "I can still believe my whole experience an illusion\u2014especially if, as I devoutly hope, that hellish abyss is never found.", "Wingate took me to Perth on July 20th, though declining to abandon the expedition and return home.", "He stayed with me until the 25th, when the steamer for Liverpool sailed.", "Now, in the cabin of theEmpress, I am pondering long and frantically upon the entire matter, and have decided that my son at least must be informed.", "It shall rest with him whether to diffuse the matter more widely.", "In order to meet any eventuality I have prepared this summary of my background\u2014as already known in a scattered way to others\u2014and will now tell as briefly as possible what seemed to happen during my absence from the camp that hideous night.", "Nerves on edge, and whipped into a kind of perverse eagerness by that inexplicable, dread-mingled, mnemonic urge toward the northeast, I plodded on beneath the evil, burning moon.", "Here and there I saw, half shrouded by sand, those primal Cyclopean blocks left from nameless and forgotten aeons.", "The incalculable age and brooding horror of this monstrous waste began to oppress me as never before, and I could not keep from thinking of my maddening dreams, of the frightful legends which lay behind them, and of the present fears of natives and miners concerning the desert and its carven stones.", "And yet I plodded on as if to some eldritch rendezvous\u2014more and more assailed by bewildering fancies, compulsions, and pseudo-memories.", "I thought of some of the possible contours of the lines of stones as seen by my son from the air, and wondered why they seemed at once so ominous and so familiar.", "Something was fumbling and rattling at the latch of my recollection, while another unknown force sought to keep the portal barred.", "The night was windless, and the pallid sand curved upward and downward like frozen waves of the sea.", "I had no goal, but somehow ploughed along as if with fate-bound assurance.", "My dreams welled up into the waking world, so that each sand-embedded megalith seemed part of endless rooms and corridors of pre-human masonry, carved and hieroglyphed with symbols that I knew too well from years of custom as a captive mind of the Great Race.", "At moments I fancied I saw those omniscient, conical horrors moving about at their accustomed tasks, and I feared to look down lest I find myself one with them in aspect.", "Yet all the while I saw the sand-covered blocks as well as the rooms and corridors; the evil, burning moon as well as the lamps of luminous crystal; the endless desert as well as the waving ferns beyond the windows.", "I was awake and dreaming at the same time.", "I do not know how long or how far\u2014or indeed, in just what direction\u2014I had walked when I first spied the heap of blocks bared by the day's wind.", "It was the largest group in one place that I had seen so far, and so sharply did it impress me that the visions of fabulous aeons faded suddenly away.", "Again there were only the desert and the evil moon and the shards of an unguessed past.", "I drew close and paused, and cast the added light of my electric torch over the tumbled pile.", "A hillock had blown away, leaving a low, irregularly round mass of megaliths and smaller fragments some forty feet across and from two to eight feet high.", "From the very outset I realized that there was some utterly unprecedented quality about those stones.", "Not only was the mere number of them quite without parallel, but something in the sandworn traces of design arrested me as I scanned them under the mingled beams of the moon and my torch.", "Not that any one differed essentially from the earlier specimens we had found.", "It was something subtler than that.", "The impression did not come when I looked at one block alone, but only when I ran my eye over several almost simultaneously.", "Then, at last, the truth dawned upon me.", "The curvilinear patterns on many of those blocks were closely related\u2014parts of one vast decorative conception.", "For the first time in this aeon-shaken waste I had come upon a mass of masonry in its old position\u2014tumbled and fragmentary, it is true, but none the less existing in a very definite sense.", "Mounting at a low place, I clambered laboriously over the heap; here and there clearing away the sand with my fingers, and constantly striving to interpret varieties of size, shape, and style, and relationships of design.", "After a while I could vaguely guess at the nature of the bygone structure, and at the designs which had once stretched over the vast surfaces of the primal masonry.", "The perfect identity of the whole with some of my dream-glimpses appalled and unnerved me.", "This was once a Cyclopean corridor thirty feet tall, paved with octagonal blocks and solidly vaulted overhead.", "There would have been rooms opening off on the right, and at the farther end one of those strange inclined planes would have wound down to still lower depths.", "I started violently as these conceptions occurred to me, for there was more in them than the blocks themselves had supplied.", "How did I know that this level should have been far underground?", "How did I know that the plane leading upward should have been behind me?", "How did I know that the long subterrene passage to the Square of Pillars ought to lie on the left one level above me?", "How did I know that the room of machines and the rightward-leading tunnel to the central archives ought to lie two levels below?", "How did I know that there would be one of those horrible, metal-banded trap-doors at the very bottom four levels down?", "Bewildered by this intrusion from the dream-world, I found myself shaking and bathed in a cold perspiration.", "Then, as a last, intolerable touch, I felt that faint, insidious stream of cool air trickling upward from a depressed place near the center of the huge heap.", "Instantly, as once before, my visions faded, and I saw again only the evil moonlight, the brooding desert, and the spreading tumulus of palaeogean masonry.", "Something real and tangible, yet fraught with infinite suggestions of nighted mystery, now confronted me.", "For that stream of air could argue but one thing\u2014a hidden gulf of great size beneath the disordered blocks on the surface.", "My first thought was of the sinister blackfellow legends of vast underground huts among the megaliths where horrors happen and great winds are born.", "Then thoughts of my own dreams came back, and I felt dim pseudo-memories tugging at my mind.", "What manner of place lay below me?", "What primal, inconceivable source of age-old myth-cycles and haunting nightmares might I be on the brink of uncovering?", "It was only for a moment that I hesitated, for more than curiosity and scientific zeal was driving me on and working against my growing fear.", "I seemed to move almost automatically, as if in the clutch of some compelling fate.", "Pocketing my torch, and struggling with a strength that I had not thought I possessed, I wrenched aside first one titan fragment of stone and then another, till there welled up a strong draught whose dampness contrasted oddly with the desert's dry air.", "A black rift began to yawn, and at length\u2014when I had pushed away every fragment small enough to budge\u2014the leprous moonlight blazed on an aperture of ample width to admit me.", "I drew out my torch and cast a brilliant beam into the opening.", "Below me was a chaos of tumbled masonry, sloping roughly down toward the north at an angle of about forty-five degrees, and evidently the result of some bygone collapse from above.", "Between its surface and the ground level was a gulf of impenetrable blackness at whose upper edge were signs of gigantic, stress-heaved vaulting.", "At this point, it appeared, the desert's sands lay directly upon a floor of some titan structure of earth's youth\u2014how preserved through aeons of geologic convulsion I could not then and cannot now even attempt to guess.", "In retrospect, the barest idea of a sudden, lone descent into such a doubtful abyss\u2014and at a time when one's whereabouts were unknown to any living soul\u2014seems like the utter apex of insanity.", "Perhaps it was\u2014yet that night I embarked without hesitancy upon such a descent.", "Again there was manifest that lure and driving of fatality which had all along seemed to direct my course.", "With torch flashing intermittently to save the battery, I commenced a mad scramble down the sinister, Cyclopean incline below the opening\u2014sometimes facing forward as I found good hand\u2014and foot-holds, and at other times turning to face the heap of megaliths as I clung and fumbled more precariously.", "In two directions beside me distant walls of carven, crumbling masonry loomed dimly under the direct beams of my torch.", "Ahead, however, was only unbroken darkness.", "I kept no track of time during my downward scramble.", "So seething with baffling hints and images was my mind that all objective matters seemed withdrawn into incalculable distances.", "Physical sensation was dead, and even fear remained as a wraith-like, inactive gargoyle leering impotently at me.", "Eventually, I reached a level floor strewn with fallen blocks, shapeless fragments of stone, and sand and detritus of every kind.", "On either side\u2014perhaps thirty feet apart\u2014rose massive walls culminating in huge groinings.", "That they were carved I could just discern, but the nature of the carvings was beyond my perception.", "What held me the most was the vaulting overhead.", "The beam from my torch could not reach the roof, but the lower parts of the monstrous arches stood out distinctly.", "And so perfect was their identity with what I had seen in countless dreams of the elder world, that I trembled actively for the first time.", "Behind and high above, a faint luminous blur told of the distant moonlit world outside.", "Some vague shred of caution warned me that I should not let it out of my sight, lest I have no guide for my return.", "I now advanced toward the wall at my left, where the traces of carving were plainest.", "The littered floor was nearly as hard to traverse as the downward heap had been, but I managed to pick my difficult way.", "At one place I heaved aside some blocks and locked away the detritus to see what the pavement was like, and shuddered at the utter, fateful familiarity of the great octagonal stones whose buckled surface still held roughly together.", "Reaching a convenient distance from the wall, I cast the searchlight slowly and carefully over its worn remnants of carving.", "Some bygone influx of water seemed to have acted on the sandstone surface, while there were curious incrustations which I could not explain.", "In places the masonry was very loose and distorted, and I wondered how many aeons more this primal, hidden edifice could keep its remaining traces of form amidst earth's heavings.", "But it was the carvings themselves that excited me most.", "Despite their time-crumbled state, they were relatively easy to trace at close range; and the complete, intimate familiarity of every detail almost stunned my imagination.", "That the major attributes of this hoary masonry should be familiar, was not beyond normal credibility.", "Powerfully impressing the weavers of certain myths, they had become embodied in a stream of cryptic lore which, somehow, coming to my notice during the amnesic period, had evoked vivid images in my subconscious mind.", "But how could I explain the exact and minute fashion in which each line and spiral of these strange designs tallied with what I had dreamed for more than a score of years?", "What obscure, forgotten iconography could have reproduced each subtle shading and nuance which so persistently, exactly, and unvaryingly besieged my sleeping vision night after night?", "For this was no chance or remote resemblance.", "Definitely and absolutely, the millennially ancient, aeon-hidden corridor in which I stood was the original of something I knew in sleep as intimately as I knew my own house in Crane Street, Arkham.", "True, my dreams shewed the place in its undecayed prime; but the identity was no less real on that account.", "I was wholly and horribly oriented.", "The particular structure I was in was known to me.", "Known, too, was its place in that terrible elder city of dreams.", "That I could visit unerringly any point in that structure or in that city which had escaped the changes and devastations of uncounted ages, I realized with hideous and instinctive certainty.", "What in heaven's name could all this mean?", "How had I come to know what I knew?", "And what awful reality could lie behind those antique tales of the beings who had dwelt in this labyrinth of primordial stone?", "Words can convey only fractionally the welter of dread and bewilderment which ate at my spirit.", "I knew this place.", "I knew what lay before me, and what had lain overhead before the myriad towering stories had fallen to dust and debris and the desert.", "No need now, I thought with a shudder, to keep that faint blur of moonlight in view.", "I was torn betwixt a longing to flee and a feverish mixture of burning curiosity and driving fatality.", "What had happened to this monstrous megalopolis of old in the millions of years since the time of my dreams?", "Of the subterrene mazes which had underlain the city and linked all the titan towers, how much had still survived the writhings of earth's crust?", "Had I come upon a whole buried world of unholy archaism?", "Could I still find the house of the writing master, and the tower where S'gg'ha, the captive mind from the star-headed vegetable carnivores of Antarctica, had chiselled certain pictures on the blank spaces of the walls?", "Would the passage at the second level down, to the hall of the alien minds, be still unchoked and traversable?", "In that hall the captive mind of an incredible entity\u2014a half-plastic denizen of the hollow interior of an unknown trans-Plutonian planet eighteen million years in the future\u2014had kept a certain thing which it had modelled from clay.", "I shut my eyes and put my hand to my head in a vain, pitiful effort to drive these insane dream-fragments from my consciousness.", "Then, for the first time, I felt acutely the coolness, motion, and dampness of the surrounding air.", "Shuddering, I realized that a vast chain of aeon-dead black gulfs must indeed be yawning somewhere beyond and below me.", "I thought of the frightful chambers and corridors and inclines as I recalled them from my dreams.", "Would the way to the central archives still be open?", "Again that driving fatality tugged insistently at my brain as I recalled the awesome records that once lay cased in those rectangular vaults of rustless metal.", "There, said the dreams and legends, had reposed the whole history, past and future, of the cosmic space-time continuum\u2014written by captive minds from every orb and every age in the solar system.", "Madness, of course\u2014but had I not now stumbled into a nighted world as mad as I?", "I thought of the locked metal shelves, and of the curious knob twistings needed to open each one.", "My own came vividly into my consciousness.", "How often had I gone through that intricate routine of varied turns and pressures in the terrestrial vertebrate section on the lowest level!", "Every detail was fresh and familiar.", "If there were such a vault as I had dreamed of, I could open it in a moment.", "It was then that madness took me utterly.", "An instant later, and I was leaping and stumbling over the rocky debris toward the well-remembered incline to the depths below.", "FROM that point forward my impressions are scarcely to be relied on\u2014indeed, I still possess a final, desperate hope that they all form parts of some daemonic dream or illusion born of delirium.", "A fever raged in my brain, and everything came to me through a kind of haze\u2014sometimes only intermittently.", "The rays of my torch shot feebly into the engulfing blackness, bringing phantasmal flashes of hideously familiar walls and carvings, all blighted with the decay of ages.", "In one place a tremendous mass of vaulting had fallen, so that I had to clamber over a mighty mound of stones reaching almost to the ragged, grotesquely stalactited roof.", "It was all the ultimate apex of nightmare, made worse by the blasphemous tug of pseudo-memory.", "One thing only was unfamiliar, and that was my own size in relation to the monstrous masonry.", "I felt oppressed by a sense of unwonted smallness, as if the sight of these towering walls from a mere human body was something wholly new and abnormal.", "Again and again I looked nervously down at myself, vaguely disturbed by the human form I possessed.", "Onward through the blackness of the abyss I leaped, plunged, and staggered\u2014often falling and bruising myself, and once nearly shattering my torch.", "Every stone and corner of that daemonic gulf was known to me, and at many points I stopped to cast beams of light through choked and crumbling, yet familiar, archways.", "Some rooms had totally collapsed; others were bare, or debris-filled.", "In a few I saw masses of metal\u2014some fairly intact, some broken, and some crushed or battered\u2014which I recognised as the colossal pedestals or tables of my dreams.", "What they could in truth have been, I dared not guess.", "I found the downward incline and began its descent\u2014though after a time halted by a gaping, ragged chasm whose narrowest point could not be much less than four feet across.", "Here the stonework had fallen through, revealing incalculable inky depths beneath.", "I knew there were two more cellar levels in this titan edifice, and trembled with fresh panic as I recalled the metal-clamped trap-door on the lowest one.", "There could be no guards now\u2014for what had lurked beneath had long since done its hideous work and sunk into its long decline.", "By the time of the posthuman beetle race it would be quite dead.", "And yet, as I thought of the native legends, I trembled anew.", "It cost me a terrible effort to vault that yawning chasm, since the littered floor prevented a running start\u2014but madness drove me on.", "I chose a place close to the left-hand wall\u2014where the rift was least wide and the landing-spot reasonably clear of dangerous debris\u2014and after one frantic moment reached the other side in safety.", "At last, gaining the lower level, I stumbled on past the archway of the room of machines, within which were fantastic ruins of metal, half buried beneath fallen vaulting.", "Everything was where I knew it would be, and I climbed confidently over the heaps which barred the entrance of a vast transverse corridor.", "This, I realised, would take me under the city to the central archives.", "Endless ages seemed to unroll as I stumbled, leaped, and crawled along that debris-cluttered corridor.", "Now and then I could make out carvings on the ages-stained walls\u2014some familiar, others seemingly added since the period of my dreams.", "Since this was a subterrene house-connecting highway, there were no archways save when the route led through the lower levels of various buildings.", "At some of these intersections I turned aside long enough to look down well-remembered corridors and into well-remembered rooms.", "Twice only did I find any radical changes from what I had dreamed of\u2014and in one of these cases I could trace the sealed-up outlines of the archway I remembered.", "I shook violently, and felt a curious surge of retarding weakness, as I steered a hurried and reluctant course through the crypt of one of those great windowless, ruined towers whose alien, basalt masonry bespoke a whispered and horrible origin.", "This primal vault was round and fully two hundred feet across, with nothing carved upon the dark-hued stonework.", "The floor was here free from anything save dust and sand, and I could see the apertures leading upward and downward.", "There were no stairs or inclines\u2014indeed, my dreams had pictured those elder towers as wholly untouched by the fabulous Great Race.", "Those who had built them had not needed stairs or inclines.", "In the dreams, the downward aperture had been tightly sealed and nervously guarded.", "Now it lay open-black and yawning, and giving forth a current of cool, damp air.", "Of what limitless caverns of eternal night might brood below, I would not permit myself to think.", "Later, clawing my way along a badly heaped section of the corridor, I reached a place where the roof had wholly caved in.", "The debris rose like a mountain, and I climbed up over it, passing through a vast, empty space where my torchlight could reveal neither walls nor vaulting.", "This, I reflected, must be the cellar of the house of the metal-purveyors, fronting on the third square not far from the archives.", "What had happened to it I could not conjecture.", "I found the corridor again beyond the mountain of detritus and stone, but after a short distance encountered a wholly choked place where the fallen vaulting almost touched the perilously sagging ceiling.", "How I managed to wrench and tear aside enough blocks to afford a passage, and how I dared disturb the tightly packed fragments when the least shift of equilibrium might have brought down all the tons of superincumbent masonry to crush me to nothingness, I do not know.", "It was sheer madness that impelled and guided me\u2014if, indeed, my whole underground adventure was not\u2014as I hope\u2014a hellish delusion or phase of dreaming.", "But I did make\u2014or dream that I made\u2014a passage that I could squirm through.", "As I wiggled over the mound of debris\u2014my torch, switched continuously on, thrust deeply in my mouth\u2014I felt myself torn by the fantastic stalactites of the jagged floor above me.", "I was now close to the great underground archival structure which seemed to form my goal.", "Sliding and clambering down the farther side of the barrier, and picking my way along the remaining stretch of corridor with hand-held, intermittently flashing torch, I came at last to a low, circular crypt with arches\u2014still in a marvelous state of preservation\u2014opening off on every side.", "The walls, or such parts of them as lay within reach of my torchlight, were densely hieroglyphed and chiselled with typical curvilinear symbols\u2014some added since the period of my dreams.", "This, I realised, was my fated destination, and I turned at once through a familiar archway on my left.", "That I could find a clear passage up and down the incline to all the surviving levels, I had, oddly, little doubt.", "This vast, earth-protected pile, housing the annals of all the solar system, had been built with supernal skill and strength to last as long as that system itself.", "Blocks of stupendous size, poised with mathematical genius and bound with cements of incredible toughness, had combined to form a mass as firm as the planet's rocky core.", "Here, after ages more prodigious than I could sanely grasp, its buried bulk stood in all its essential contours, the vast, dust-drifted floors scarce sprinkled with the litter elsewhere so dominant.", "The relatively easy walking from this point onward went curiously to my head.", "All the frantic eagerness hitherto frustrated by obstacles now took itself out in a kind of febrile speed, and I literally raced along the low-roofed, monstrously well-remembered aisles beyond the archway.", "I was past being astonished by the familiarity of what I saw.", "On every hand the great hieroglyphed metal shelf-doors loomed monstrously; some yet in place, others sprung open, and still others bent and buckled under bygone geological stresses not quite strong enough to shatter the titan masonry.", "Here and there a dust-covered heap beneath a gaping, empty shelf seemed to indicate where cases had been shaken down by earth tremors.", "On occasional pillars were great symbols or letters proclaiming classes and subclasses of volumes.", "Once I paused before an open vault where I saw some of the accustomed metal cases still in position amidst the omnipresent gritty dust.", "Reaching up, I dislodged one of the thinner specimens with some difficulty, and rested it on the floor for inspection.", "It was titled in the prevailing curvilinear hieroglyphs, though something in the arrangement of the characters seemed subtly unusual.", "The odd mechanism of the hooked fastener was perfectly well known to me, and I snapped up the still rustless and workable lid and drew out the book within.", "The latter, as expected, was some twenty by fifteen inches in area, and two inches thick; the thin metal covers opening at the top.", "Its tough cellulose pages seemed unaffected by the myriad cycles of time they had lived through, and I studied the queerly pigmented, brush-drawn letters of the text-symbols unlike either the usual curved hieroglyphs or any alphabet known to human scholarship\u2014with a haunting, half-aroused memory.", "It came to me that this was the language used by a captive mind I had known slightly in my dreams\u2014a mind from a large asteroid on which had survived much of the archaic life and lore of the primal planet whereof it formed a fragment.", "At the same time I recalled that this level of the archives was devoted to volumes dealing with the non-terrestrial planets.", "As I ceased poring over this incredible document I saw that the light of my torch was beginning to fail, hence quickly inserted the extra battery I always had with me.", "Then, armed with the stronger radiance, I resumed my feverish racing through unending tangles of aisles and corridors\u2014recognising now and then some familiar shelf, and vaguely annoyed by the acoustic conditions which made my footfalls echo incongruously in these catacombs.", "The very prints of my shoes behind me in the millennially untrodden dust made me shudder.", "Never before, if my mad dreams held anything of truth, had human feet pressed upon those immemorial pavements.", "Of the particular goal of my insane racing, my conscious mind held no hint.", "There was, however, some force of evil potency pulling at my dazed will and buried recollection, so that I vaguely felt I was not running at random.", "I came to a downward incline and followed it to profounder depths.", "Floors flashed by me as I raced, but I did not pause to explore them.", "In my whirling brain there had begun to beat a certain rhythm which set my right hand twitching in unison.", "I wanted to unlock something, and felt that I knew all the intricate twists and pressures needed to do it.", "It would be like a modern safe with a combination lock.", "Dream or not, I had once known and still knew.", "How any dream\u2014or scrap of unconsciously absorbed legend\u2014could have taught me a detail so minute, so intricate, and so complex, I did not attempt to explain to myself.", "I was beyond all coherent thought.", "For was not this whole experience\u2014this shocking familiarity with a set of unknown ruins, and this monstrously exact identity of everything before me with what only dreams and scraps of myth could have suggested\u2014a horror beyond all reason?", "Probably it was my basic conviction then\u2014as it is now during my saner moments\u2014that I was not awake at all, and that the entire buried city was a fragment of febrile hallucination.", "Eventually, I reached the lowest level and struck off to the right of the incline.", "For some shadowy reason I tried to soften my steps, even though I lost speed thereby.", "There was a space I was afraid to cross on this last, deeply buried floor.", "As I drew near it I recalled what thing in that space I feared.", "It was merely one of the metal-barred and closely guarded trap-doors.", "There would be no guards now, and on that account I trembled and tiptoed as I had done in passing through that black basalt vault where a similar trap-door had yawned.", "I felt a current of cool, damp air as I had felt there, and wished that my course led in another direction.", "Why I had to take the particular course I was taking, I did not know.", "When I came to the space I saw that the trap-door yawned widely open.", "Ahead, the shelves began again, and I glimpsed on the floor before one of them a heap very thinly covered with dust, where a number of cases had recently fallen.", "At the same moment a fresh wave of panic clutched me, though for some time I could not discover why.", "Heaps of fallen cases were not uncommon, for all through the aeons this lightless labyrinth had been racked by the heavings of earth and had echoed at intervals of the deafening clatter of toppling objects.", "It was only when I was nearly across the space that I realized why I shook so violently.", "Not the heap, but something about the dust of the level floor was troubling me.", "In the light of my torch it seemed as if that dust were not as even as it ought to be\u2014there were places where it looked thinner, as if it had been disturbed not many months before.", "I could not be sure, for even the apparently thinner places were dusty enough; yet a certain suspicion of regularity in the fancied unevenness was highly disquieting.", "When I brought the torchlight close to one of the queer places I did not like what I saw\u2014for the illusion of regularity became very great.", "It was as if there were regular lines of composite impressions\u2014impressions that went in threes, each slightly over a foot square, and consisting of five nearly circular three-inch prints, one in advance of the other four.", "These possible lines of foot-square impressions appeared to lead in two directions, as if something had gone somewhere and returned.", "They were, of course, very faint, and may have been illusions or accidents; but there was an element of dim, fumbling terror about the way I thought they ran.", "For at one end of them was the heap of cases which must have clattered down not long before, while at the other end was the ominous trap-door with the cool, damp wind, yawning unguarded down to abysses past imagination.", "THAT my strange sense of compulsion was deep and overwhelming is shewn by its conquest of my fear.", "No rational motive could have drawn me on after that hideous suspicion of prints and the creeping dream-memories it excited.", "Yet my right hand, even as it shook with fright, still twitched rhythmically in its eagerness to turn a lock it hoped to find.", "Before I knew it I was past the heap of lately fallen cases and running on tiptoe through aisles of utterly unbroken dust toward a point which I seemed to know morbidly, horribly well.", "My mind was asking itself questions whose origin and relevancy I was only beginning to guess.", "Would the shelf be reachable by a human body?", "Could my human hand master all the aeon-remembered motions of the lock?", "Would the lock be undamaged and workable?", "And what would I do\u2014what dare I do with what\u2014as I now commenced to realise\u2014I both hoped and feared to find?", "Would it prove the awesome, brain-shattering truth of something past normal conception, or shew only that I was dreaming?", "The next I knew I had ceased my tiptoed racing and was standing still, staring at a row of maddeningly familiar hieroglyphed shelves.", "They were in a state of almost perfect preservation, and only three of the doors in this vicinity had sprung open.", "My feelings toward these shelves cannot be described\u2014so utter and insistent was the sense of old acquaintance.", "I was looking high up at a row near the top and wholly out of my reach, and wondering how I could climb to best advantage.", "An open door four rows from the bottom would help, and the locks of the closed doors formed possible holds for hands and feet.", "I would grip the torch between my teeth, as I had in other places where both hands were needed.", "Above all I must make no noise.", "How to get down what I wished to remove would be difficult, but I could probably hook its movable fastener in my coat collar and carry it like a knapsack.", "Again I wondered whether the lock would be undamaged.", "That I could repeat each familiar motion I had not the least doubt.", "But I hoped the thing would not scrape or creak\u2014and that my hand could work it properly.", "Even as I thought these things I had taken the torch in my mouth and begun to climb.", "The projecting locks were poor supports; but, as I had expected, the opened shelf helped greatly.", "I used both the swinging door and the edge of the aperture itself in my ascent, and managed to avoid any loud creaking.", "Balanced on the upper edge of the door, and leaning far to my right, I could just reach the lock I sought.", "My fingers, half numb from climbing, were very clumsy at first; but I soon saw that they were anatomically adequate.", "And the memory-rhythm was strong in them.", "Out of unknown gulfs of time the intricate, secret motions had somehow reached my brain correctly in every detail\u2014for after less than five minutes of trying there came a click whose familiarity was all the more startling because I had not consciously anticipated it.", "In another instant the metal door was slowly swinging open with only the faintest grating sound.", "Dazedly I looked over the row of greyish case ends thus exposed, and felt a tremendous surge of some wholly inexplicable emotion.", "Just within reach of my right hand was a case whose curving hieroglyphs made me shake with a pang infinitely more complex than one of mere fright.", "Still shaking, I managed to dislodge it amidst a shower of gritty flakes, and ease it over toward myself without any violent noise.", "Like the other case I had handled, it was slightly more than twenty by fifteen inches in size, with curved mathematical designs in low relief.", "In thickness it just exceeded three inches.", "Crudely wedging it between myself and the surface I was climbing, I fumbled with the fastener and finally got the hook free.", "Lifting the cover, I shifted the heavy object to my back, and let the hook catch hold of my collar.", "Hands now free, I awkwardly clambered down to the dusty floor, and prepared to inspect my prize.", "Kneeling in the gritty dust, I swung the case around and rested it in front of me.", "My hands shook, and I dreaded to draw out the book within almost as much as I longed\u2014and felt compelled\u2014to do so.", "It had very gradually become clear to me what I ought to find, and this realisation nearly paralysed my faculties.", "If the thing were there\u2014and if I were not dreaming\u2014the implications would be quite beyond the power of the human spirit to bear.", "What tormented me most was my momentary inability to feel that my surroundings were a dream.", "The sense of reality was hideous\u2014and again becomes so as I recall the scene.", "At length I tremblingly pulled the book from its container and stared fascinatedly at the well-known hieroglyphs on the cover.", "It seemed to be in prime condition, and the curvilinear letters of the title held me in almost as hypnotised a state as if I could read them.", "Indeed, I cannot swear that I did not actually read them in some transient and terrible access of abnormal memory.", "I do not know how long it was before I dared to lift that thin metal cover.", "I temporized and made excuses to myself.", "I took the torch from my mouth and shut it off to save the battery.", "Then, in the dark, I collected my courage finally lifting the cover without turning on the light.", "Last of all, I did indeed flash the torch upon the exposed page\u2014steeling myself in advance to suppress any sound no matter what I should find.", "I looked for an instant, then collapsed.", "Clenching my teeth, however, I kept silent.", "I sank wholly to the floor and put a hand to my forehead amidst the engulfing blackness.", "What I dreaded and expected was there.", "Either I was dreaming, or time and space had become a mockery.", "I must be dreaming\u2014but I would test the horror by carrying this thing back and shewing it to my son if it were indeed a reality.", "My head swam frightfully, even though there were no visible objects in the unbroken gloom to swirl about me.", "Ideas and images of the starkest terror\u2014excited by vistas which my glimpse had opened up\u2014began to throng in upon me and cloud my senses.", "I thought of those possible prints in the dust, and trembled at the sound of my own breathing as I did so.", "Once again I flashed on the light and looked at the page as a serpent's victim may look at his destroyer's eyes and fangs.", "Then, with clumsy fingers, in the dark, I closed the book, put it in its container, and snapped the lid and the curious, hooked fastener.", "This was what I must carry back to the outer world if it truly existed\u2014if the whole abyss truly existed\u2014if I, and the world itself, truly existed.", "Just when I tottered to my feet and commenced my return I cannot be certain.", "It comes to me oddly\u2014as a measure of my sense of separation from the normal world\u2014that I did not even once look at my watch during those hideous hours underground.", "Torch in hand, and with the ominous case under one arm, I eventually found myself tiptoeing in a kind of silent panic past the draught-giving abyss and those lurking suggestions of prints.", "I lessened my precautions as I climbed up the endless inclines, but could not shake off a shadow of apprehension which I had not felt on the downward journey.", "I dreaded having to repass through the black basalt crypt that was older than the city itself, where cold draughts welled up from unguarded depths.", "I thought of that which the Great Race had feared, and of what might still be lurking\u2014be it ever so weak and dying\u2014down there.", "I thought of those five-circle prints and of what my dreams had told me of such prints\u2014and of strange winds and whistling noises associated with them.", "And I thought of the tales of the modern blackfellows, wherein the horror of great winds and nameless subterrene ruins was dwelt upon.", "I knew from a carven wall symbol the right floor to enter, and came at last after passing that other book I had examined\u2014to the great circular space with the branching archways.", "On my right, and at once recognisable, was the arch through which I had arrived.", "This I now entered, conscious that the rest of my course would be harder because of the tumbled state of the masonry outside the archive building.", "My new metal-cased burden weighed upon me, and I found it harder and harder to be quiet as I stumbled among debris and fragments of every sort.", "Then I came to the ceiling-high mound of debris through which I had wrenched a scanty passage.", "My dread at wriggling through again was infinite, for my first passage had made some noise, and I now\u2014after seeing those possible prints\u2014dreaded sound above all things.", "The case, too, doubled the problem of traversing the narrow crevice.", "But I clambered up the barrier as best I could, and pushed the case through the aperture ahead of me.", "Then, torch in mouth, I scrambled through myself\u2014my back torn as before by stalactites.", "As I tried to grasp the case again, it fell some distance ahead of me down the slope of the debris, making a disturbing clatter and arousing echoes which sent me into a cold perspiration.", "I lunged for it at once, and regained it without further noise\u2014but a moment afterward the slipping of blocks under my feet raised a sudden and unprecedented din.", "The din was my undoing.", "For, falsely or not, I thought I heard it answered in a terrible way from spaces far behind me.", "I thought I heard a shrill, whistling sound, like nothing else on earth, and beyond any adequate verbal description.", "If so, what followed has a grim irony\u2014since, save for the panic of this thing, the second thing might never have happened.", "As it was, my frenzy was absolute and unrelieved.", "Taking my torch in my hand and clutching feebly at the case, I leaped and bounded wildly ahead with no idea in my brain beyond a mad desire to race out of these nightmare ruins to the waking world of desert and moonlight which lay so far above.", "I hardly knew it when I reached the mountain of debris which towered into the vast blackness beyond the caved-in roof, and bruised and cut myself repeatedly in scrambling up its steep slope of jagged blocks and fragments.", "Then came the great disaster.", "Just as I blindly crossed the summit, unprepared for the sudden dip ahead, my feet slipped utterly and I found myself involved in a mangling avalanche of sliding masonry whose cannon-loud uproar split the black cavern air in a deafening series of earth-shaking reverberations.", "I have no recollection of emerging from this chaos, but a momentary fragment of consciousness shows me as plunging and tripping and scrambling along the corridor amidst the clangour\u2014case and torch still with me.", "Then, just as I approached that primal basalt crypt I had so dreaded, utter madness came.", "For as the echoes of the avalanche died down, there became audible a repetition of that frightful alien whistling I thought I had heard before.", "This time there was no doubt about it\u2014and what was worse, it came from a point not behind but ahead of me.", "Probably I shrieked aloud then.", "I have a dim picture of myself as flying through the hellish basalt vault of the elder things, and hearing that damnable alien sound piping up from the open, unguarded door of limitless nether blacknesses.", "There was a wind, too\u2014not merely a cool, damp draught, but a violent, purposeful blast belching savagely and frigidly from that abominable gulf whence the obscene whistling came.", "There are memories of leaping and lurching over obstacles of every sort, with that torrent of wind and shrieking sound growing moment by moment, and seeming to curl and twist purposefully around me as it struck out wickedly from the spaces behind and beneath.", "Though in my rear, that wind had the odd effect of hindering instead of aiding my progress; as if it acted like a noose or lasso thrown around me.", "Heedless of the noise I made, I clattered over a great barrier of blocks and was again in the structure that led to the surface.", "I recall glimpsing the archway to the room of machines and almost crying out as I saw the incline leading down to where one of those blasphemous trap-doors must be yawning two levels below.", "But instead of crying out I muttered over and over to myself that this was all a dream from which I must soon awake.", "Perhaps I was in camp\u2014perhaps I was at home in Arkham.", "As these hopes bolstered up my sanity I began to mount the incline to the higher level.", "I knew, of course, that I had the four-foot cleft to re-cross, yet was too racked by other fears to realise the full horror until I came almost upon it.", "On my descent, the leap across had been easy\u2014but could I clear the gap as readily when going uphill, and hampered by fright, exhaustion, the weight of the metal case, and the anomalous backward tug of that daemon wind?", "I thought of these things at the last moment, and thought also of the nameless entities which might be lurking in the black abysses below the chasm.", "My wavering torch was growing feeble, but I could tell by some obscure memory when I neared the cleft.", "The chill blasts of wind and the nauseous whistling shrieks behind me were for the moment like a merciful opiate, dulling my imagination to the horror of the yawning gulf ahead.", "And then I became aware of the added blasts and whistling in front of me\u2014tides of abomination surging up through the cleft itself from depths unimagined and unimaginable.", "Now, indeed, the essence of pure nightmare was upon me.", "Sanity departed\u2014and, ignoring everything except the animal impulse of flight, I merely struggled and plunged upward over the incline's debris as if no gulf had existed.", "Then I saw the chasm's edge, leaped frenziedly with every ounce of strength I possessed, and was instantly engulfed in a pandaemoniae vortex of loathsome sound and utter, materially tangible blackness.", "This is the end of my experience, so far as I can recall.", "Any further impressions belong wholly to the domain of phantasmagoria delirium.", "Dream, madness, and memory merged wildly together in a series of fantastic, fragmentary delusions which can have no relation to anything real.", "There was a hideous fall through incalculable leagues of viscous, sentient darkness, and a babel of noises utterly alien to all that we know of the earth and its organic life.", "Dormant, rudimentary senses seemed to start into vitality within me, telling of pits and voids peopled by floating horrors and leading to sunless crags and oceans and teeming cities of windowless, basalt towers upon which no light ever shone.", "Secrets of the primal planet and its immemorial aeons flashed through my brain without the aid of sight or sound, and there were known to me things which not even the wildest of my former dreams had ever suggested.", "And all the while cold fingers of damp vapor clutched and picked at me, and that eldritch, damnable whistling shrieked fiendishly above all the alternations of babel and silence in the whirlpools of darkness around.", "Afterward there were visions of the Cyclopean city of my dreams\u2014not in ruins, but just as I had dreamed of it.", "I was in my conical, non-human body again, and mingled with crowds of the Great Race and the captive minds who carried books up and down the lofty corridors and vast inclines.", "Then, superimposed upon these pictures, were frightful, momentary flashes of a non-vistial consciousness involving desperate struggles, a writhing free from clutching tentacles of whistling wind, an insane, bat-like flight through half-solid air, a feverish burrowing through the cyclone-whipped dark, and a wild stumbling and scrambling over fallen masonry.", "Once there was a curious, intrusive flash of half sight\u2014a faint, diffuse suspicion of bluish radiance far overhead.", "Then there came a dream of wind\u2014pursued climbing and crawling\u2014of wriggling into a blaze of sardonic moonlight through a jumble of debris which slid and collapsed after me amidst a morbid hurricane.", "It was the evil, monotonous beating of that maddening moonlight which at last told me of the return of what I had once known as the objective, waking world.", "I was clawing prone through the sands of the Australian desert, and around me shrieked such a tumult of wind as I had never before known on our planet's surface.", "My clothing was in rags, and my whole body was a mass of bruises and scratches.", "Full consciousness returned very slowly, and at no time could I tell just where delirious dream left off and true memory began.", "There had seemed to be a mound of titan blocks, an abyss beneath it, a monstrous revelation from the past, and a nightmare horror at the end\u2014but how much of this was real?", "My flashlight was gone, and likewise any metal case I may have discovered.", "Had there been such a case\u2014or any abyss\u2014or any mound?", "Raising my head, I looked behind me, and saw only the sterile, undulant sands of the desert.", "The daemon wind died down, and the bloated, fungoid moon sank reddeningly in the west.", "I lurched to my feet and began to stagger southwestward toward the camp.", "What in truth had happened to me?", "Had I merely collapsed in the desert and dragged a dream-racked body over miles of sand and buried blocks?", "If not, how could I bear to live any longer?", "For, in this new doubt, all my faith in the myth-born unreality of my visions dissolved once more into the hellish older doubting.", "If that abyss was real, then the Great Race was real\u2014and its blasphemous reachings and seizures in the cosmos-wide vortex of time were no myths or nightmares, but a terrible, soul-shattering actuality.", "Had I, in full, hideous fact, been drawn back to a pre-human world of a hundred and fifty million years ago in those dark, baffling days of the amnesia?", "Had my present body been the vehicle of a frightful alien consciousness from palaeogean gulfs of time?", "Had I, as the captive mind of those shambling horrors, indeed known that accursed city of stone in its primordial heyday, and wriggled down those familiar corridors in the loathsome shape of my captor?", "Were those tormenting dreams of more than twenty years the offspring of stark, monstrous memories?", "Had I once veritably talked with minds from reachless corners of time and space, learned the universe's secrets, past and to come, and written the annals of my own world for the metal cases of those titan archives?", "And were those others\u2014those shocking elder things of the mad winds and daemon pipings\u2014in truth a lingering, lurking menace, waiting and slowly weakening in black abysses while varied shapes of life drag out their multimillennial courses on the planet's age-racked surface?", "I do not know.", "If that abyss and what I held were real, there is no hope.", "Then, all too truly, there lies upon this world of man a mocking and incredible shadow out of time.", "But, mercifully, there is no proof that these things are other than fresh phases of my myth-born dreams.", "I did not bring back the metal case that would have been a proof, and so far those subterrene corridors have not been found.", "If the laws of the universe are kind, they will never be found.", "But I must tell my son what I saw or thought I saw, and let him use his judgment as a psychologist in gauging the reality of my experience, and communicating this account to others.", "I have said that the awful truth behind my tortured years of dreaming hinges absolutely upon the actuality of what I thought I saw in those Cyclopean, buried ruins.", "It has been hard for me, literally, to set down that crucial revelation, though no reader can have failed to guess it.", "Of course, it lay in that book within the metal case\u2014the case which I pried out of its lair amidst the dust of a million centuries.", "No eye had seen, no hand had touched that book since the advent of man to this planet.", "And yet, when I flashed my torch upon it in that frightful abyss, I saw that the queerly pigmented letters on the brittle, aeon-browned cellulose pages were not indeed any nameless hieroglyphs of earth's youth.", "They were, instead, the letters of our familiar alphabet, spelling out the words of the English language in my own handwriting."]
