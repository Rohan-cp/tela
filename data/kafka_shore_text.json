pretty steep.", "After\n\nwe'd hiked for about ten minutes we came to a clearing, a broad area as flat\n\nas a tabletop.", "Once we'd entered the woods it was completely still, and with\n\nthe sun blocked out it was chilly, but when we stepped into that clearing it\n\nwas like we were in a miniature town square, with the sky bright above us.", "My class often stopped by this spot whenever we climbed Owan yama.", "The\n\nplace had a calming effect, and somehow made us all feel nice and cozy.", "We took a break once we reached this \"square,\" putting down our\n\npacks, and then the

exactly\n\nwhat's on his mind.", "Behind his glasses his eyes have a very sharp, alert\n\nlook, and his memory seems reliable.", "That's correct\u2014at eleven a.m. on November 7, 1944, I received a\n\nphone call from the assistant principal at the local elementary school.", "I used\n\nto be the school doctor, or something close to it, so that's why they\n\ncontacted me first.", "The assistant principal was terribly upset.", "He told me that an entire\n\nclass had lost consciousness while on an outing in the hills to pick\n\nmushrooms.", "According to him they were totally unconscious.", "Only the\n\nteacher in charge had remained conscious, and she'd run back to school for\n\nhelp just then.", "She was so flustered I couldn't grasp the whole situation,\n\nthough one fact did come through loud and clear: sixteen children had\n\ncollapsed in the woods.", "The kids were out picking mushrooms, so of course my first thought\n\nwas that they'd eaten some poisonous ones and been paralyzed.", "If that were\n\nthe case it'd be difficult to treat.", "Different varieties of mushrooms have\n\ndifferent toxicity levels, and the treatments vary.", "The most we could do at\n\nthe moment would be to pump out their stomachs.", "In the case of highly\n\ntoxic varieties, though, the poison might enter the bloodstream quickly and\n\nwe might be too late.", "Around here, several people a year die from poison\n\nmushrooms.", "I stuffed some emergency medicine in my bag and rode my bike over\n\nto the school as fast as I could.", "The police had been contacted and two\n\npolicemen were already there.", "We knew we had to get the unconscious kids\n\nback to town and would need all the help we could get.", "Most of the young\n\nmen were away at war, though, so we set off with the best we had\u2014myself,\n\nthe two policemen, an elderly male teacher, the assistant principal and\n\nprincipal, the school janitor.", "And of course the homeroom teacher who'd\n\nbeen with the kids.", "We grabbed whatever bicycles we could find, but there\n\nweren't enough, so some of us rode two to a bike.", "\u2014What time did you arrive at the site?", "It was 11:55.", "I remember since I happened to glance at my watch when\n\nwe got there.", "We rode our bicycles to the bottom of the hill, as far as we\n\ncould go, then climbed the rest of the way on foot.", "By the time I arrived several children had partially regained\n\nconsciousness.", "Three or four of them, as I recall.", "But they weren't fully\n\nconscious\u2014sort of dizzily on all fours.", "The rest of the children were still collapsed.", "After a while some of the\n\nothers began to come around, their bodies undulating like so many big\n\nworms.", "It was a very strange sight.", "The children had collapsed in an odd,\n\nflat, open space in the woods where it looked like all the trees had been\n\nneatly removed, with autumn sunlight shining down brightly.", "And here you\n\nhad, in this spot or at the edges of it, sixteen elementary-school kids\n\nscattered about prostrate on the ground, some of them starting to move,\n\nsome of them completely still.", "The whole thing reminded me of some weird\n\navant-garde play.", "For a moment I forgot that I was supposed to treat the kids and just\n\nstood there, frozen, staring at the scene.", "Not just myself\u2014everyone in the\n\nrescue group reacted the same, paralyzed for a while by what they saw.", "This\n\nmight be a strange way of putting it, perhaps, but it was like some mistake\n\nhad occurred that allowed us to see a sight people should never see.", "It was\n\nwartime, and I was always mentally prepared, as a physician, to deal with\n\nwhatever came, in the remote possibility that something awful would occur\n\nway out here in the country.", "Prepared as a citizen of Japan to calmly do my\n\nduty if the need arose.", "But when I saw this scene in the woods I literally\n\nfroze.", "I soon snapped out of it, and picked up one of the children, a little girl.", "Her body had no strength in it at all and was limp as a rag doll.", "Her\n\nbreathing was steady but she was still unconscious.", "Her eyes, though, were\n\nopen, tracking something back and forth.", "I pulled a small flashlight out of\n\nmy bag and shined it on her pupils.", "Completely unreactive.", "Her eyes were\n\nfunctioning, watching something, yet showed no response to light.", "I picked\n\nup several other children and examined them and they were all exactly the\n\nsame, unresponsive.", "I found this quite odd.", "I next checked their pulse and temperature.", "Their pulses were between\n\n50 and 55, and all of them had temperatures just below 97 degrees.", "Somewhere around 96 degrees or thereabouts, as I recall.", "That's correct\u2014\n\nfor children of that age this pulse rate is well below normal, the body\n\ntemperature over one degree below average.", "I smelled their breath, but there\n\nwas nothing out of the ordinary.", "Likewise with their throats and tongues.", "I immediately ascertained these weren't the symptoms of food\n\npoisoning.", "Nobody had vomited or suffered diarrhea, and none of them\n\nseemed to be in any pain.", "If the children had eaten something bad you could\n\nexpect\u2014with this much time having elapsed\u2014the onset of at least one of\n\nthese symptoms.", "I heaved a sigh of relief that it wasn't food poisoning.", "But\n\nthen I was stumped, since I hadn't a clue what was wrong with them.", "The symptoms were similar to sunstroke.", "Kids often collapse from this\n\nin the summer.", "It's like it's contagious\u2014once one of them collapses their\n\nfriends all do the same, one after the other.", "But this was November, in a\n\ncool woods, no less.", "One or two getting sunstroke is one thing, but sixteen\n\nchildren simultaneously coming down with it was out of the question.", "My next thought was some kind of poison gas or nerve gas, either\n\nnaturally occurring or man-made.", "But how in the world could gas appear in\n\nthe middle of the woods in such a remote part of the country?", "I couldn't\n\naccount for it.", "Poison gas, though, would logically explain what I saw that\n\nday.", "Everyone breathed it in, went unconscious, and collapsed on the spot.", "The homeroom teacher didn't collapse because the concentration of gas\n\nwasn't strong enough to affect an adult.", "But when it came to treating the children, I was totally lost.", "I'm just a\n\nsimple country doctor and have no special expertise in poison gasses, so I\n\nwas out of my league.", "We were out in this remote town and I couldn't very well ring up a\n\nspecialist.", "Very gradually, in fact, some of the children were getting better,\n\nand I figured that perhaps with time they would all regain consciousness.", "I\n\nknow it's an overly optimistic view, but at the time I couldn't think of\n\nanything else to do.", "So I suggested that we just let them lie there quietly for\n\na while and see what developed.", "\u2014Was there anything unusual in the air?", "I was concerned about that myself, so I took several deep breaths to\n\nsee if I could detect any unusual odor.", "But it was just the ordinary smell of a\n\nwoods in the hills.", "It was a bracing scent, the fragrance of

about that.", "We basically had no choice\n\nexcept to believe him, but he sounded believable.", "We also concluded that it\n\nwas highly unlikely that poison gas had been dropped from a B-29.", "If the\n\nAmericans had actually developed such a weapon and decided to use it,\n\nthey'd drop it on some large city where the effects would be massive.", "Dropping a canister or two on such a remote place wouldn't allow them to\n\nascertain what effects the weapon had.", "Besides, even if you accepted the\n\npremise that a poison gas had been dropped on the spot, any gas that makes\n\nchildren fall unconscious for two hours with no other lasting effects would\n\nbe worthless as military arsenal.", "Also we knew that no poison gas, whether manmade or naturally\n\noccurring, would act like this, leaving no aftereffects whatsoever.", "Especially\n\nwhen you're dealing with children, who are more sensitive and have a more\n\ndelicate immune system than adults, there would have to be some\n\naftereffects, particularly in the eyes or mucous membranes.", "We crossed off\n\nfood poisoning for the same reason.", "So what we were left with were psychological problems, or problems\n\ndealing with brain function.", "In a case like that, standard medical\n\nmethodology wouldn't help at all in isolating the cause.", "The effects would\n\nbe invisible, something you couldn't quantify.", "We finally understood why\n\nwe had been called here by the military to consult.", "We interviewed every child involved in the incident, as well as the\n\nhomeroom teacher and attending physician.", "Major Toyama also\n\nparticipated.", "But these interviews yielded almost nothing new\u2014we merely\n\nconfirmed what the major had already told us.", "The children had no memory whatsoever of the event.", "They saw what\n\nlooked like a plane glinting high up in the sky, climbed up Owan yama, and\n\nbegan hunting mushrooms.", "Then there's a gap in time and the next thing\n\nthey recall is lying on the ground, surrounded by a group of worried-\n\nlooking teachers and policemen.", "They felt fine, without any pain,\n\ndiscomfort, or nausea.", "Their minds just felt a bit blank, as you do when you\n\nfirst wake up in the morning.", "That was all.", "Each child gave the same exact\n\nresponse.", "After conducting these interviews we concluded that this was a case of\n\nmass hypnosis.", "From the symptoms the homeroom teacher and school\n\ndoctor observed at the scene, this hypothesis made the most sense.", "The\n\nregular movement of the eyes, the slight lowering of respiration, heartbeat,\n\nand temperature, the lack of memory\u2014it all fit.", "The teacher alone didn't lose consciousness because for whatever\n\nreason what produced this mass hypnosis didn't affect adults.", "We weren't able to pinpoint the cause, however.", "Generally speaking,\n\nthough, mass hypnotism requires two elements.", "First, the group must be\n\nclose-knit and homogeneous, and placed in restricted circumstances.", "Secondly, something has to trigger the reaction, something that acts\n\nsimultaneously on everyone.", "In this case it might have been the glint of that\n\nairplane they saw.", "This is just a hypothesis, mind you\u2014we weren't able to\n\nfind any other candidates\u2014and there may very well have been some other\n\ntrigger that set it off.", "I broached the idea of it being a case of mass hypnosis\n\nwith Major Toyama, making it clear this was merely a conjecture.", "My two\n\ncolleagues generally concurred.", "Coincidentally, this

stone\n\nbefore I went to bed.", "I'm sure this is the place.\"", "\"Thank God.\"", "Hoshino nodded and returned to his biography.", "Beethoven, he learned,\n\nwas a proud man who believed absolutely in his own abilities and never\n\nbothered to flatter the nobility.", "Believing that art itself, and the proper\n\nexpression of emotions, was the most sublime thing in the world, he\n\nthought political power and wealth served only one purpose: to make art\n\npossible.", "When Haydn boarded with a noble family, as he did most of his\n\nprofessional life, he had to eat with the servants.", "Musicians of Haydn's\n\ngeneration were considered employees.", "(The unaffected and good-natured\n\nHaydn, though, much preferred this arrangement to the stiff and formal\n\nmeals put on by the nobility.)", "Beethoven, in contrast, was enraged by any\n\nsuch contemptuous treatment, on occasion smashing things against the wall\n\nin anger.", "He insisted that as far as meals went he be treated with no less\n\nrespect than the nobility he ostensibly served.", "He often flew off the handle,\n\nand once angry was hard to calm down.", "On top of this were radical political\n\nideas that he made no attempt to hide.", "As his hearing deteriorated, these\n\ntendencies became even more pronounced.", "As he aged his music also\n\nbecame both more expansive and more densely inward looking.", "Only\n\nBeethoven could have balanced these two contrasting tendencies.", "But the\n\nextraordinary effort this required had a progressively deleterious effect on\n\nhis life, for all humans have physical and emotional limits, and by this time\n\nthe composer had more than reached his.", "Geniuses like that don't have it easy, Hoshino thought, impressed, and\n\nlaid down his book.", "He remembered the bronze bust of a scowling\n\nBeethoven in the music room of his school, but until now he'd had no idea\n\nof the hardships the man had endured.", "No wonder the guy looked so sour.", "I'm never gonna be a genius, that's for sure, Hoshino thought.", "He looked over at Nakata, who was deep into a photo collection of\n\ntraditional folk furniture, and working an imaginary chisel and plane.", "These\n\nphotos must've made him unconsciously feel like he was back at his old job.", "And Nakata\u2014who knows?", "He might become a great person someday,\n\nHoshino thought.", "Most people can't do the kinds of things he does.", "The old\n\ncodger's definitely in a class all his own.", "After twelve, two other readers, middle-aged women, came into the\n\nreading room, so Hoshino and Nakata used the opportunity to take a\n\nbreather outside.", "Hoshino had brought some bread along for their lunch,\n\nwhile Nakata was lugging around his usual thermos of hot tea.", "Hoshino first\n\nasked Oshima at the counter whether it was all right to eat on the library\n\ngrounds.", "\"Of course,\" Oshima replied.", "\"It's nice to sit on the veranda\n\noverlooking the garden.", "Afterward, feel free to come in for a cup of coffee.", "I've already made some, so help yourself.\"", "\"Thanks,\" Hoshino said.", "\"This is quite a homey place you have here.\"", "Oshima smiled and brushed back his hair.", "\"It is a little different from\n\nyour normal library.", "Homey is a good way to describe it.", "What we're trying\n\nto create is sort of an intimate space where people can relax and enjoy\n\nreading.\"", "Hoshino found Oshima an appealing young man.", "Intelligent, well\n\ngroomed, obviously from a good family.", "And quite kind.", "He's got to be gay,\n\nright?", "Not that Hoshino cared.", "To each his own, was his thinking.", "Some\n\nmen talk with stones, and some sleep with other men.", "Go figure.", "After lunch, Hoshino stood up, stretched his whole body, then went\n\nback to the reception area to take Oshima up on his offer of a cup of coffee.", "Since Nakata didn't drink coffee, he stayed on the veranda sipping his tea\n\nand gazing at the birds flitting around the garden.", "\"So, did you find anything interesting to read?\"", "Oshima asked\n\nHoshino.", "\"Yeah, I've been reading a biography of Beethoven,\" Hoshino replied.", "\"I like it.", "His life really gives you a lot to think about.\"", "Oshima nodded.", "\"He went through a lot\u2014to put it mildly.\"", "\"He did have a tough time,\" Hoshino said, \"but I think it was mainly\n\nhis fault.", "I mean, he was so self-centered and uncooperative.", "All he thought\n\nabout was himself and his music, and he didn't mind sacrificing whatever he\n\nhad to for it.", "He must've been tough to get along with.", "Hey, Ludwig, gimme\n\na break!", "That's what I would have said if I knew him.", "No wonder his\n\nnephew went off his rocker.", "But I have to admit his music is wonderful.", "It\n\nreally gets to you.", "It's a strange thing.\"", "\"Absolutely,\" Oshima agreed.", "\"But why did he have to live such a hard, wild life?", "He would've been\n\nbetter off with a more normal type of life.\"", "Oshima twirled the pencil around in his fingers.", "\"I see your point, but\n\nby Beethoven's time people thought it was important to express the ego.", "Earlier, when there was an absolute monarchy, this would've been\n\nconsidered improper, socially deviant behavior and suppressed quite\n\nseverely.", "Once the bourgeoisie came to power in the nineteenth century,\n\nhowever, that suppression came to an end and the individual ego was\n\nliberated to express itself.", "Freedom and the emancipation of the ego were\n\nsynonymous.", "And art, music in particular, was at the forefront of all this.", "Those who came after Beethoven and lived under his shadow, so to speak\u2014\n\nBerlioz, Wagner, Liszt, Schumann\u2014all lived eccentric, stormy lives.", "Eccentricity was seen as almost the ideal lifestyle.", "The age of Romanticism,\n\nthey called it.", "Though I'm sure living like that was pretty hard on them at\n\ntimes.", "So, you like Beethoven's music?\"", "\"I can't really say if I do or not.", "I haven't heard that much,\" Hoshino\n\nadmitted.", "\"Hardly any at all, actually.", "I just kind of like that piece called the\n\nArchduke Trio.\"", "\"That is nice, yes.\"", "\"The Million-Dollar Trio's great,\" Hoshino added.", "\"I prefer the Czech group, the Suk Trio, myself,\" Oshima said.", "\"They\n\nhave a beautiful balance.", "You feel like you can smell the wind wafting over\n\na green meadow.", "But I do know the Million-Dollar Trio version\u2014Rubinstein, Heifetz,\n\nand Feuermann.", "It's an elegant performance.\"", "\"Um, Mr.\u2014Oshima?\"", "Hoshino asked, looking at the nameplate on the\n\ncounter.", "\"You know a lot about music, I can tell.\"", "Oshima smiled.", "\"Not a lot.", "I just enjoy listening to it.\"", "\"Do you think music has the power to change people?", "Like you listen\n\nto a piece and go through some major change inside?\"", "Oshima nodded.", "\"Sure, that can happen.", "We have an experience\u2014like\n\na chemical reaction\u2014that transforms something inside us.", "When we\n\nexamine ourselves later on, we discover that all the standards we've lived by\n\nhave shot up another notch and the world's opened up in unexpected ways.", "Yes, I've had that experience.", "Not often, but it has happened.", "It's like falling\n\nin love.\"", "Hoshino had never fallen head over heels in love himself, but he went\n\nahead and nodded anyway.", "\"That's gotta be a very important thing, right?\"", "he said.", "\"For our lives?\"", "\"It is,\" Oshima answered.", "\"Without those peak experiences our lives\n\nwould be pretty dull and flat.", "Berlioz put it this way: A life without once\n\nreading Hamlet is like a life spent in a coal mine.\"", "\"A coal mine?\"", "\"Just typical nineteenth-century hyperbole.\"", "\"Well, thanks for the coffee,\" Hoshino said.", "\"I'm happy we could talk.\"", "Oshima gave him a big grin in reply.", "Hoshino and Nakata read books until two, Nakata going through his\n\ncarpenter's motions as he leafed through the collection of furniture\n\nphotographs.", "Besides the middle-aged ladies, three other readers had joined\n\nthem after lunch.", "But only Hoshino and Nakata asked to join the tour of the\n\nlibrary.", "\"You don't mind if it's just the two of us?\"", "Hoshino asked.", "\"I

librarian here,\" the\n\nwoman said, and smiled calmly.", "\"I'm Hoshino.\"", "\"I'm Nakata, and I'm from Nakano,\" the old man said, hiking hat in\n\nhand.", "\"We're glad you've come to visit us from so far away,\" Miss Saeki said.", "A chill ran down Hoshino's spine at Nakata's words, but Miss Saeki\n\ndidn't look suspicious.", "Nakata was typically oblivious.", "\"Yes, I crossed over a very big bridge,\"\n\nhe said.", "\"This is a wonderful building,\" Hoshino interjected, trying to cut off\n\nany talk of bridges.", "\"The building was built in the early Meiji period as the library

the\n\nmovies, or the aquarium\u2014so it's the least I can do for him, now that he's\n\ngone.", "He drained his second can of Pepsi, went over to the sofa, crouched\n\ndown, and tried lifting the stone.", "It wasn't so heavy.", "Not exactly light,\n\neither, but it didn't take all that much to lift it up.", "About as heavy as when\n\nhe and Colonel Sanders had stolen it from the shrine.", "About as heavy as the\n\nkind of stones used to weigh down pickles as they ferment.", "That means\n\nright now it's just a stone, Hoshino thought.", "When the stone's acting as an\n\nentrance, it's so heavy you have to kill yourself to pick it up.", "But when it's\n\n\n\n\n\nlight like this, it's just an ordinary stone.", "Something extraordinary has to\n\nhappen first, for the stone to become

going\n\nthrough Mr. Nakata just to get inside the entrance.", "It showed up when it\n\nwanted to, using Mr. Nakata as a kind of passageway for its own purposes.", "And I can't let that happen.", "That's why I've got to kill it.", "Like the cat said,\n\nliquidate it with extreme prejudice.", "Hoshino went over to Nakata and quickly stabbed his knife into what\n\nseemed to be the head of the thing.", "He pulled out the knife and stabbed\n\nagain, over and over.", "But there was little resistance to the knife, just the\n\ncrisp feel you get when you plunge a knife into a soft vegetable.",

nothing inside\u2014just the same mushy white as the outer skin.", "He\n\nslashed at it a few times, finally severing part of the head, which squirmed\n\nlike a slug on the floor for a moment, then stopped moving like it was dead.", "This had no effect on the rest of the body, which continued to ooze forward.", "Mucus soon covered up the wound, swelling up so the thing looked the\n\nsame as before.", "None of this slowed it down as it wiggled on out of the old man's\n\nmouth.", "Finally, the whole object was out, revealing its entire form.", "The\n\ncreature was about a yard long, with a tail, which finally allowed Hoshino\n\nto figure out for sure which end was which.", "The tail was like a\n\nsalamander's, short and thick, the tip abruptly tapering down to a thin point.", "It had no legs, no eyes, no mouth or nose.", "But it most definitely had a will\n\nof its own.", "No, Hoshino thought, it's more like a will is all it has.", "He didn't need to figure that out logically, he just knew it.", "When it's on\n\nthe move, he thought, it just happens to take on this shape.", "A chill ran up\n\nhis spine.", "Anyway, he concluded, I've got to kill it.", "He tried the hammer next, but it didn't do any good.", "He'd pound one\n\npart of the creature only to see the surrounding flesh and mucus fill in the\n\ndepression he'd made.", "He carried over a small table and started bashing the\n\nthing with one of the legs, but nothing slowed down its inexorable advance.", "Like some clumsy snake it slowly, steadily crawled toward the next room\n\nand the entrance stone.", "This isn't like any other living creature I've ever seen, Hoshino\n\nthought.", "No weapon has any effect on it.", "There's no heart you can stab, no\n\nthroat you can throttle.", "So what the hell can I do?", "This thing is evil, and no\n\nmatter what I've got to keep it from getting into the entrance.", "Toro said I'd\n\nknow it when I saw it, and damn if he isn't right.", "I can't let this thing

try,\" Hoshino said.", "He rested his hands on the stone, took a\n\nhuge breath, filling his lungs, and held the air in.", "He focused all his energy\n\non one spot and put both hands on one side of the stone.", "If he couldn't lift it\n\nthis time, he wouldn't have a second chance.", "This is it, Hoshino!", "Now or\n\nnever.", "I'm gonna do this if it kills me!", "With all the strength he could muster\n\nhe gave a groan and lifted.", "The stone raised up slightly.", "He put his last ounce of energy into it and managed\u2014like he was\n\nstripping the stone off the floor\u2014to lift it up.", "His head felt faint and the muscles in his arms were screaming with\n\npain.", "His balls felt like they'd long since been busted.", "Still, he couldn't raise\n\nit any higher.", "Hoshino thought of Nakata, how the old man had given his life to open\n\nand close the stone.", "Somehow, some way, he had to see it through to the\n\nbitter end.", "Toro told him he had to take over from the old man.", "His muscles\n\nwere aching for fresh blood, his lungs dying for air to make that blood, but\n\nhe couldn't breathe.", "He knew he was about as close to death as you can get,\n\nthe abyss of nothingness gaping open right before his eyes.", "But he ignored\n\nthis, focused all his strength one last time, and pulled the stone toward him.", "It lifted up and, with a massive thud, flipped over and fell to the floor.", "The\n\nfloor shook with the shock, the glass door rattling.", "The stone was\n\ntremendously, profoundly heavy.", "Hoshino sat there gasping for air.", "\"You did good,\" he told himself a\n\nfew moments later, once he finally caught his breath.", "Once he'd closed the entrance, taking care of the white object was\n\nsurprisingly simple.", "It was shut out of where it was headed, and it knew it.", "It stopped its forward advance and started crawling around the room\n\nlooking for a place to hide, perhaps hoping to crawl back inside Nakata's\n\nmouth.",

a\n\nwhile on the floor, but soon lost strength and stopped moving.", "They curled\n\nup into tight little balls and died, the carpet glistening with their slime.", "Hoshino gathered all the pieces with a dustpan, dumped them in a garbage\n\nbag that he tied closed with string, then put this bag inside another that he\n\nalso tied up tight.", "This he put inside a thick cloth bag he found in the closet.", "Completely drained, he squatted on the floor, his shoulders heaving as\n\nhe took deep breaths.", "His hands were shaking.", "He wanted to say something,\n\nbut couldn't form the words.", "\"You did a good job, Hoshino,\" he managed to\n\nsay a few moments later.", "With all the noise he'd made attacking that white creature and flipping\n\nthe stone over, he was worried that people in the apartment building had\n\nwoken up and were even now dialing 911.", "Fortunately, nothing happened.", "No police sirens, no one pounding on the door.", "The last thing he needed\n\nwas for the police to come barging in.", "Hoshino knew the bits and pieces of the white thing stuffed tightly in\n\nthe bags weren't about to come back to life.", "There's no place left for them to\n\ngo, he thought.", "But it was a good idea just to make sure, so he decided that\n\nas soon as it was light he'd go to the beach and burn them all up.", "Turn them\n\ninto ash.", "And once that was over he'd head back to Nagoya.", "Back home.", "It was nearly four by this time, and getting light out.", "Time to get going.", "Hoshino stuffed his clothes into his bag, including\u2014just to be on the safe\n\nside\u2014his sunglasses and Chunichi Dragons ball cap.", "Getting snagged by\n\nthe police before he could finish would mess up the whole thing.", "He took\n\nalong a bottle of cooking oil to use to light the fire.", "He remembered his CD\n\nof the Archduke Trio and tossed it in his bag as well.", "Finally, he went into the room where Nakata lay in bed.", "The AC was\n\nstill on full blast, and the room was freezing.", "\"Hey there, Mr. Nakata,\" he\n\nsaid, \"I'm about ready to take off.", "Sorry, but I can't stay here forever.", "I'll call\n\nthe cops from the station so they
