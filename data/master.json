["Never Talk with Strangers\n\nAt the hour of the hot spring sunset two citizens appeared at the Patriarch\u2019s\n\nPonds.", "1 One of them, approximately forty years old, dressed in a grey\n\nsummer suit, was short, dark-haired, plump, bald, and carried his\n\nrespectable fedora hat in his hand.", "His neatly shaven face was adorned with\n\nblack horn-rimmed glasses of a supernatural size.", "The other, a broad-\n\nshouldered young man with tousled reddish hair, his checkered cap cocked\n\nback on his head, was wearing a cowboy shirt, wrinkled white trousers and\n\nblack sneakers.", "The first was none other than Mikhail Alexandrovich Berlioz, 2 editor of a\n\nfat literary journal and chairman of the board of one of the major Moscow\n\nliterary associations, called Massolit3 for short, and his young companion\n\nwas the poet Ivan Nikolaevich Ponyrev, who wrote under the pseudonym of\n\nHomeless.", "4\n\nOnce in the shade of the barely greening lindens, the writers dashed first\n\nthing to a brightly painted stand with the sign: \u2018Beer and Soft Drinks.\u2019\n\nAh, yes, note must be made of the first oddity of this dreadful May\n\nevening.", "There was not a single person to be seen, not only by the stand, but\n\nalso along the whole walk parallel to Malaya Bronnaya Street.", "At that hour\n\nwhen it seemed no longer possible to breathe, when the sun, having\n\nscorched Moscow, was collapsing in a dry haze somewhere beyond\n\nSadovoye Ring, no one came under the lindens, no one sat on a bench, the\n\nwalk was empty.", "\u2018Give us seltzer,\u2019 Berlioz asked.", "\u2018There is no seltzer,\u2019 the woman in the stand said, and for some reason\n\nbecame offended.", "\u2018Is there beer?\u2019 Homeless inquired in a rasping voice.", "\u2018Beer\u2019ll be delivered towards evening,\u2019 the woman replied.", "\u2018Then what is there?\u2019 asked Berlioz.", "\u2018Apricot soda, only warm,\u2019 said the woman.", "\u2018Well, let\u2019s have it, let\u2019s have it!", "...\u2019\n\nThe soda produced an abundance of yellow foam, and the air began to\n\nsmell of a barber-shop.", "Having finished drinking, the writers immediately\n\nstarted to hiccup, paid, and sat down on a bench face to the pond and back\n\nto Bronnaya.", "Here the second oddity occurred, touching Berlioz alone.", "He suddenly\n\nstopped hiccuping, his heart gave a thump and dropped away somewhere\n\nfor an instant, then came back, but with a blunt needle lodged in it.", "Besides\n\nthat, Berlioz was gripped by fear, groundless, yet so strong that he wanted\n\nto flee the Ponds at once without looking back.", "Berlioz looked around in anguish, not understanding what had frightened\n\nhim.", "He paled, wiped his forehead with a handkerchief, thought: \u2018What\u2019s\n\nthe matter with me?", "This has never happened before.", "My heart\u2019s acting up\n\n... I\u2019m overworked ... Maybe it\u2019s time to send it all to the devil and go to\n\nKislovodsk ...\u20195\n\nAnd here the sweltering air thickened before him, and a transparent\n\ncitizen of the strangest appearance wove himself out of it.", "A peaked\n\njockey\u2019s cap on his little head, a short checkered jacket also made of air ...\n\nA citizen seven feet tall, but narrow in the shoulders, unbelievably thin,\n\nand, kindly note, with a jeering physiognomy.", "The life of Berlioz had taken such a course that he was unaccustomed to\n\nextraordinary phenomena.", "Turning paler still, he goggled his eyes and\n\nthought in consternation: \u2018This can\u2019t be!...\u2019\n\nBut, alas, it was, and the long, see-through citizen was swaying before\n\nhim to the left and to the right without touching the ground.", "Here terror took such possession of Berlioz that he shut his eyes.", "When\n\nhe opened them again, he saw that it was all over, the phantasm had\n\ndissolved, the checkered one had vanished, and with that the blunt needle\n\nhad popped out of his heart.", "\u2018Pah, the devil!\u2019 exclaimed the editor.", "\u2018You know, Ivan, I nearly had\n\nheatstroke just now!", "There was even something like a hallucination ...\u2019 He\n\nattempted to smile, but alarm still jumped in his eyes and his hands\n\ntrembled.", "However, he gradually calmed down, fanned himself with his\n\nhandkerchief and, having said rather cheerfully: \u2018Well, and so ...\u2019 went on\n\nwith the conversation interrupted by their soda-drinking.", "This conversation, as was learned afterwards, was about Jesus Christ.", "The thing was that the editor had commissioned from the poet a long anti-\n\nreligious poem for the next issue of his journal.", "Ivan Nikolaevich had\n\nwritten this poem, and in a very short time, but unfortunately the editor was\n\nnot at all satisfied with it.", "Homeless had portrayed the main character of his\n\npoem \u2014 that is, Jesus \u2014 in very dark colours, but nevertheless the whole\n\npoem, in the editor\u2019s opinion, had to be written over again.", "And so the\n\neditor was now giving the poet something of a lecture on Jesus, with the\n\naim of underscoring the poet\u2019s essential error.", "It is hard to say what precisely had let Ivan Nikolaevich down \u2014 the\n\ndescriptive powers of his talent or a total unfamiliarity with the question he\n\nwas writing about \u2014 but his Jesus came out, well, completely alive, the\n\nonce-existing Jesus, though, true, a Jesus furnished with all negative\n\nfeatures.", "Now, Berlioz wanted to prove to the poet that the main thing was not\n\nhow Jesus was, good or bad, but that this same Jesus, as a person, simply\n\nnever existed in the world, and all the stories about him were mere fiction,\n\nthe most ordinary mythology.", "It must be noted that the editor was a well-read man and in his\n\nconversation very skilfully pointed to ancient historians \u2014 for instance, the\n\nfamous Philo of Alexandria6 and the brilliantly educated Flavius Josephus7\n\n\u2014 who never said a word about the existence of Jesus.", "Displaying a solid\n\nerudition, Mikhail Alexandrovich also informed the poet, among other\n\nthings, that the passage in the fifteenth book of Tacitus\u2019s famous Annals, 8\n\nthe forty-fourth chapter, where mention is made of the execution of Jesus,\n\nwas nothing but a later spurious interpolation.", "The poet, for whom everything the editor was telling him was new,\n\nlistened attentively to Mikhail Alexandrovich, fixing his pert green eyes on\n\nhim, and merely hiccuped from time to time, cursing the apricot soda under\n\nhis breath.", "There\u2019s not a single Eastern religion,\u2018 Berlioz was saying, \u2019in which, as a\n\nrule, an immaculate virgin did not give birth to a god.", "And in just the same\n\nway, without inventing anything new, the Christians created their Jesus,\n\nwho in fact never lived.", "It\u2019s on this that the main emphasis should be placed\n\n...\u2018\n\nBerlioz\u2019s high tenor rang out in the deserted walk, and as Mikhail\n\nAlexandrovich went deeper into the maze, which only a highly educated\n\nman can go into without risking a broken neck, the poet learned more and\n\nmore interesting and useful things about the Egyptian Osiris, 9 a benevolent\n\ngod and the son of Heaven and Earth, and about the Phoenician god\n\nTammuz,10 and about Marduk, 11 and even about a lesser known, terrible god, Vitzliputzli, 12 once greatly venerated by the Aztecs in Mexico.", "And\n\njust at the moment when Mikhail Alexandrovich was telling the poet how\n\nthe Aztecs used to fashion figurines of Vitzliputzli out of dough \u2014 the first\n\nman appeared in the walk.", "Afterwards, when, frankly speaking, it was already too late, various\n\ninstitutions presented reports describing this man.", "A comparison of them\n\ncannot but cause amazement.", "Thus, the first of them said that the man was\n\nshort, had gold teeth, and limped on his right leg.", "The second, that the man\n\nwas enormously tall, had platinum crowns, and limped on his left leg.", "The\n\nthird laconically averred that the man had no distinguishing marks.", "It must\n\nbe acknowledged that none of these reports is of any value.", "First of all, the man described did not limp on any leg, and was neither\n\nshort nor enormous, but simply tall.", "As for his teeth, he had platinum\n\ncrowns on the left side and gold on the right.", "He was wearing an expensive\n\ngrey suit and imported shoes of a matching colour.", "His grey beret was\n\ncocked rakishly over one ear; under his arm he carried a stick with a black\n\nknob shaped like a poodle\u2019s head.", "13 He looked to be a little over forty.", "Mouth somehow twisted.", "Clean-shaven.", "Dark-haired.", "Right eye black, left\n\n\u2014 for some reason \u2014 green.", "Dark eyebrows, but one higher than the other.", "In short, a foreigner.14\n\nHaving passed by the bench on which the editor and the poet were\n\nplaced, the foreigner gave them a sidelong look, stopped, and suddenly sat\n\ndown on the next bench, two steps away from the friends.", "\u2018A German...\u2019 thought Berlioz.", "\u2018An Englishman ...\u2019 thought Homeless.", "\u2018My, he must be hot in those gloves.\u2019\n\nAnd the foreigner gazed around at the tall buildings that rectangularly\n\nframed the pond, making it obvious that he was seeing the place for the first\n\ntime and that it interested him.", "He rested his glance on the upper floors,\n\nwhere the glass dazzlingly reflected the broken-up sun which was for ever\n\ndeparting from Mikhail Alexandrovich, then shifted it lower down to where\n\nthe windows were beginning to darken before evening, smiled\n\ncondescendingly at something, narrowed his eyes, put his hands on the\n\nknob and his chin on his hands.", "\u2018For instance, Ivan,\u2019 Berlioz was saying, \u2018you portrayed the birth of\n\nJesus, the son of God, very well and satirically, but the gist of it is that a\n\nwhole series of sons of God were born before Jesus, like, say, the\n\nPhoenician Adonis, 15 the Phrygian Attis, 16 the Persian Mithras.17 And, to put it briefly, not one of them was born or ever existed, Jesus included, and\n\nwhat\u2019s necessary is that, instead of portraying his birth or, suppose, the\n\ncoming of the Magi, 18 you portray the absurd rumours of their coming.", "Otherwise it follows from your story that he really was born!", "...\u2019\n\nHere Homeless made an attempt to stop his painful hiccuping by holding\n\nhis breath, which caused him to hiccup more painfully and loudly, and at\n\nthat same moment Berlioz interrupted his speech, because the foreigner\n\nsuddenly got up and walked towards the writers.", "They looked at him in\n\nsurprise.", "\u2018Excuse me, please,\u2019 the approaching man began speaking, with a foreign\n\naccent but without distorting the words, \u2018if, not being your acquaintance, I\n\nallow myself... but the subject of your learned conversation is so interesting\n\nthat ...\u2019\n\nHere he politely took off his beret, and the friends had nothing left but to\n\nstand up and make their bows.", "\u2018No, rather a Frenchman ...\u2019 thought Berlioz.", "\u2018A Pole?", "...\u2019 thought Homeless.", "It must be added that from his first words the foreigner made a repellent\n\nimpression on the poet, but Berlioz rather liked him \u2014 that is, not liked but\n\n... how to put it ... was interested, or whatever.", "\u2018May I sit down?\u2019 the foreigner asked politely, and the friends somehow\n\ninvoluntarily moved apart; the foreigner adroitly sat down between them\n\nand at once entered into the conversation:\n\n\u2018Unless I heard wrong, you were pleased to say that Jesus never existed?\u2019\n\nthe foreigner asked, turning his green left eye to Berlioz.", "\u2018No, you did not hear wrong,\u2019 Berlioz replied courteously, \u2018that is\n\nprecisely what I was saying.\u2019\n\n\u2018Ah, how interesting!\u2019 exclaimed the foreigner.", "\u2018What the devil does he want?\u2019 thought Homeless, frowning.", "\u2018And you were agreeing with your interlocutor?\u2019 inquired the stranger,\n\nturning to Homeless on his right.", "\u2018A hundred per cent!\u2019 confirmed the man, who was fond of whimsical\n\nand figurative expressions.", "\u2018Amazing!\u2019 exclaimed the uninvited interlocutor and, casting a thievish\n\nglance around and muffling his low voice for some reason, he said:\n\n\u2018Forgive my importunity, but, as I understand, along with everything else,\n\nyou also do not believe in God?\u2019 He made frightened eyes and added: \u2018I\n\nswear I won\u2019t tell anyone!\u2019\n\n\u2018No, we don\u2019t believe in God,\u2019 Berlioz replied, smiling slightly at the\n\nforeign tourist\u2019s fright, \u2018but we can speak of it quite freely.\u2019\n\nThe foreigner sat back on the bench and asked, even with a slight shriek\n\nof curiosity:\n\n\u2018You are \u2014 atheists?", "!\u2019\n\n\u2018Yes, we\u2019re atheists,\u2019 Berlioz smilingly replied, and Homeless thought,\n\ngetting angry: \u2018Latched on to us, the foreign goose!\u2019\n\n\u2018Oh, how lovely!\u2019 the astonishing foreigner cried out and began\n\nswivelling his head, looking from one writer to the other.", "\u2018In our country atheism does not surprise anyone,\u2019 Berlioz said with\n\ndiplomatic politeness.", "\u2018The majority of our population consciously and long\n\nago ceased believing in the fairy tales about God.\u2019\n\nHere the foreigner pulled the following stunt: he got up and shook the\n\namazed editor\u2019s hand, accompanying it with these words:\n\n\u2018Allow me to thank you with all my heart!\u2019\n\n\u2018What are you thanking him for?\u2019 Homeless inquired, blinking.", "\u2018For some very important information, which is of great interest to me as\n\na traveller,\u2019 the outlandish fellow explained, raising his finger significantly.", "The important information apparently had indeed produced a strong\n\nimpression on the traveller, because he passed his frightened glance over\n\nthe buildings, as if afraid of seeing an atheist in every window.", "\u2018No, he\u2019s not an Englishman ...\u2019 thought Berlioz, and Homeless thought:\n\n\u2018Where\u2019d he pick up his Russian, that\u2019s the interesting thing!\u2019 and frowned\n\nagain.", "\u2018But, allow me to ask you,\u2019 the foreign visitor spoke after some anxious\n\nreflection, \u2018what, then, about the proofs of God\u2019s existence, of which, as is\n\nknown, there are exactly five?\u2019\n\n\u2018Alas!\u2019 Berlioz said with regret.", "\u2018Not one of these proofs is worth\n\nanything, and mankind shelved them long ago.", "You must agree that in the\n\nrealm of reason there can be no proof of God\u2019s existence.\u2019\n\nBravo!\u2018 cried the foreigner.", "\u2019Bravo!", "You have perfectly repeated restless\n\nold Immanuel\u2018s19 thought in this regard.", "But here\u2019s the hitch: he roundly\n\ndemolished all five proofs, and then, as if mocking himself, constructed a\n\nsixth of his own.\u2019\n\n\u2018Kant\u2019s proof,\u2019 the learned editor objected with a subtle smile, \u2018is equally\n\nunconvincing.", "Not for nothing did Schiller20 say that the Kantian reasoning\n\non this question can satisfy only slaves, and Strauss21 simply laughed at this\n\nproof.\u2019\n\nBerlioz spoke, thinking all the while: \u2018But, anyhow, who is he?", "And why\n\ndoes he speak Russian so well?\u2019\n\nThey ought to take this Kant and give him a three-year stretch in\n\nSolovki22 for such proofs!\u2018 Ivan Nikolaevich plumped quite unexpectedly.", "\u2018Ivan!\u2019 Berlioz whispered, embarrassed.", "But the suggestion of sending Kant to Solovki not only did not shock the\n\nforeigner, but even sent him into raptures.", "\u2018Precisely, precisely,\u2019 he cried, and his green left eye, turned to Berlioz,\n\nflashed.", "\u2018Just the place for him!", "Didn\u2019t I tell him that time at breakfast: \u201cAs\n\nyou will, Professor, but what you\u2019ve thought up doesn\u2019t hang together.", "It\u2019s\n\nclever, maybe, but mighty unclear.", "You\u2019ll be laughed at.\u201d\u2019\n\nBerlioz goggled his eyes.", "\u2018At breakfast ... to Kant?", "... What is this\n\ndrivel?\u2019 he thought.", "\u2018But,\u2019 the outlander went on, unembarrassed by Berlioz\u2019s amazement and\n\naddressing the poet, \u2018sending him to Solovki is unfeasible, for the simple\n\nreason that he has been abiding for over a hundred years now in places\n\nconsiderably more remote than Solovki, and to extract him from there is in\n\nno way possible, I assure you.\u2019\n\nToo bad!\u2018 the feisty poet responded.", "\u2018Yes, too bad!\u2019 the stranger agreed, his eye flashing, and went on: \u2018But\n\nhere is a question that is troubling me: if there is no God, then, one may ask,\n\nwho governs human life and, in general, the whole order of things on\n\nearth?\u2019\n\n\u2018Man governs it himself,\u2019 Homeless angrily hastened to reply to this\n\nadmittedly none-too-clear question.", "\u2018Pardon me,\u2019 the stranger responded gently, \u2018but in order to govern, one\n\nneeds, after all, to have a precise plan for a certain, at least somewhat\n\ndecent, length of time.", "Allow me to ask you, then, how can man govern, if\n\nhe is not only deprived of the opportunity of making a plan for at least some\n\nridiculously short period \u2014 well, say, a thousand years - but cannot even\n\nvouch for his own tomorrow?", "\u2018And in fact,\u2019 here the stranger turned to Berlioz, \u2018imagine that you, for\n\ninstance, start governing, giving orders to others and yourself, generally, so\n\nto speak, acquire a taste for it, and suddenly you get ... hem ... hem ... lung\n\ncancer ...\u2019 \u2014 here the foreigner smiled sweetly, as if the thought of lung\n\ncancer gave him pleasure \u2014 \u2018yes, cancer\u2019 \u2014 narrowing his eyes like a cat,\n\nhe repeated the sonorous word \u2014 \u2019and so your governing is over!", "\u2018You are no longer interested in anyone\u2019s fate but your own.", "Your family\n\nstarts lying to you.", "Feeling that something is wrong, you rush to learned\n\ndoctors, then to quacks, and sometimes to fortune-tellers as well.", "Like the\n\nfirst, so the second and third are completely senseless, as you understand.", "And it all ends tragically: a man who still recently thought he was\n\ngoverning something, suddenly winds up lying motionless in a wooden box,\n\nand the people around him, seeing that the man lying there is no longer\n\ngood for anything, burn him in an oven.", "\u2018And sometimes it\u2019s worse still: the man has just decided to go to\n\nKislovodsk\u2019 \u2014 here the foreigner squinted at Berlioz -

\u00e9migr\u00e925 who has crossed back over.", "Ask for his papers before he gets away...\u2019\n\n\u2018You think so?\u2019 Berlioz whispered worriedly, and thought: \u2018Why, he\u2019s\n\nright ...\u2019\n\n\u2018Believe me,\u2019 the poet rasped into his ear, \u2018he\u2019s pretending to be a fool in\n\norder to find out something or other.", "Just hear how he speaks Russian.\u2019 As\n\nhe spoke, the poet kept glancing sideways, to make sure the stranger did not\n\nescape.", "\u2018Let\u2019s go and detain him, or he\u2019ll get away ...\u2019\n\nAnd the poet pulled Berlioz back to the bench by the arm.", "The unknown man was not sitting, but was standing near it, holding in\n\nhis hands some booklet in a dark-grey binding, a sturdy envelope made of\n\ngood paper, and a visiting card.", "\u2018Excuse me for having forgotten, in the heat of our dispute, to introduce\n\nmyself.", "Here is my card, my passport, and an invitation to come to Moscow\n\nfor a consultation,\u2019 the stranger said weightily, giving both writers a\n\npenetrating glance.", "They were embarrassed.", "\u2018The devil, he heard everything ...\u2019 Berlioz\n\nthought, and with a polite gesture indicated that there was no need to show\n\npapers.", "While the foreigner was pushing them at the editor, the poet\n\nmanaged to make out the word \u2018Professor\u2019 printed in foreign type on the\n\ncard, and the initial letter of the last name \u2014 a double \u2019V\u2019 \u2014 \u2018W\u2019.", "\u2018My pleasure,\u2019 the editor meanwhile muttered in embarrassment, and the\n\nforeigner put the papers back in his pocket.", "Relations were thus restored, and all three sat down on the bench again.", "\u2018You\u2019ve been invited here as a consultant, Professor?\u2019 asked Berlioz.", "\u2018Yes, as a consultant.\u2019\n\n\u2018You\u2019re German?\u2019 Homeless inquired.", "\u2018I?", "...\u2019 the professor repeated and suddenly fell to thinking.", "\u2018Yes, perhaps\n\nI am German...\u2019 he said.", "\u2018You speak real good Russian,\u2019 Homeless observed.", "\u2018Oh, I\u2019m generally a polyglot and know a great number of languages,\u2019\n\nthe professor replied.", "\u2018And what is your field?\u2019 Berlioz inquired.", "\u2018I am a specialist in black magic.\u2019\n\n\u2018There he goes!", "...\u2019 struck in Mikhail Alexandrovich\u2019s head.", "\u2018And ... and you\u2019ve been invited here in that capacity?\u2019 he asked,\n\nstammering.", "\u2018Yes, in that capacity,\u2019 the professor confirmed, and explained: \u2018In a state\n\nlibrary here some original manuscripts of the tenth-century necromancer\n\nGerbert of Aurillac26 have been found.", "So it is necessary for me to sort\n\nthem out.", "I am the only specialist in the world.\u2019\n\n\u2018Aha!", "You\u2019re a historian?\u2019 Berlioz asked with great relief and respect.", "\u2018I am a historian,\u2019 the scholar confirmed, and added with no rhyme or\n\nreason: \u2018This evening there will be an interesting story at the Ponds!\u2019\n\nOnce again editor and poet were extremely surprised, but the professor\n\nbeckoned them both to him, and when they leaned towards him, whispered:\n\n\u2018Bear in mind that Jesus did exist.\u2019\n\n\u2018You see, Professor,\u2019 Berlioz responded with a forced smile, \u2018we respect\n\nyour great learning, but on this question we hold to a different point of\n\nview.\u2019\n\nThere\u2019s no need for any points of view,\u2018 the strange professor replied, \u2019he\n\nsimply existed, that\u2019s all.\u2018\n\n\u2018But there\u2019s need for some proof...\u2019 Berlioz began.", "\u2018There\u2019s no need for any proofs,\u2019 replied the professor, and he began to\n\nspeak softly, while his accent for some reason disappeared: \u2018It\u2019s all very\n\nsimple: In a white cloak with blood-red lining, with the shuffling gait of a\n\ncavalryman, early in the morning of the fourteenth day of the spring month\n\nof Nisan...\u201927\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 2\n\nPontius Pilate\n\nIn a white cloak with blood-red lining, with the shuffling gait of a\n\ncavalryman, early in the morning of the fourteenth day of the spring month\n\nof Nisan, there came out to the covered colonnade between the two wings\n\nof the palace of Herod the Great1 the procurator of Judea,2 Pontius Pilate.3\n\nMore than anything in the world the procurator hated the smell of rose\n\noil, and now everything foreboded a bad day, because this smell had been\n\npursuing the procurator since dawn.", "It seemed to the procurator that a rosy smell exuded from the cypresses\n\nand palms in the garden, that the smell of leather trappings and sweat from\n\nthe convoy was mingled with the cursed rosy flux.", "From the outbuildings at the back of the palace, where the first cohort of\n\nthe Twelfth Lightning legion, 4 which had come to Yershalaim5 with the procurator, was quartered, a whiff of smoke reached the colonnade across\n\nthe upper terrace of the palace, and this slightly acrid smoke, which testified\n\nthat the centuries\u2019 mess cooks had begun to prepare dinner, was mingled\n\nwith the same thick rosy scent.", "\u2018Oh, gods, gods, why do you punish me?", "...", "Yes, no doubt, this is it, this\n\nis it again, the invincible, terrible illness ... hemicrania, when half of the\n\nhead aches ... there\u2019s no remedy for it, no escape ... I\u2019ll try not to move my\n\nhead ...\u2019\n\nOn the mosaic floor by the fountain a chair was already prepared, and the\n\nprocurator, without looking at anyone, sat in it and reached his hand out to\n\none side.", "His secretary deferentially placed a sheet of parchment in this\n\nhand.", "Unable to suppress a painful grimace, the procurator ran a cursory,\n\nsidelong glance over the writing, returned the parchment to the secretary,\n\nand said with difficulty:\n\n\u2018The accused is from Galilee?", "6 Was the case sent to the tetrarch?\u2019\n\n\u2018Yes, Procurator,\u2019 replied the secretary.", "\u2018And what then?\u2019\n\n\u2018He refused to make a decision on the case and sent the Sanhedrin\u2019s7\n\ndeath sentence to you for confirmation,\u2018 the secretary explained.", "The procurator twitched his cheek and said quietly:\n\n\u2018Bring in the accused.\u2019\n\nAnd at once two legionaries brought a man of about twenty-seven from\n\nthe garden terrace to the balcony under the columns and stood him before\n\nthe procurator\u2019s chair.", "The man was dressed in an old and torn light-blue\n\nchiton.", "His head was covered by a white cloth with a leather band around\n\nthe forehead, and his hands were bound behind his back.", "Under the man\u2019s\n\nleft eye there was a large bruise, in the comer of his mouth a cut caked with\n\nblood.", "The man gazed at the procurator with anxious curiosity.", "The latter paused, then asked quietly in Aramaic:8\n\n\u2018So it was you who incited the people to destroy the temple of\n\nYershalaim?\u20199\n\nThe procurator sat as if made of stone while he spoke, and only his lips\n\nmoved slightly as he pronounced the words.", "The procurator was as if made\n\nof stone because he was afraid to move his head, aflame with infernal pain.", "The man with bound hands leaned forward somewhat and began to\n\nspeak:\n\n\u2018Good man!", "Believe me ...\u2019\n\nBut the procurator, motionless as before and not raising his voice in the\n\nleast, straight away interrupted him:\n\n\u2018Is it me that you are calling a good man?", "You are mistaken.", "It is\n\nwhispered about me in Yershalaim that I am a fierce monster, and that is\n\nperfectly correct.\u2019 And he added in the same monotone: \u2018Bring the\n\ncenturion Ratslayer.\u2019\n\nIt seemed to everyone that it became darker on the balcony when the\n\ncenturion of the first century, Mark, nicknamed Ratslayer, presented himself\n\nbefore the procurator.", "Ratslayer was a head taller than the tallest soldier of\n\nthe legion and so broad in the shoulders that he completely blocked out the\n\nstill-low sun.", "The procurator addressed the centurion in Latin:\n\nThe criminal calls me \u201cgood man\u201d.", "Take him outside for a moment,\n\nexplain to him how I ought to be spoken to.", "But no maiming.\u2018\n\nAnd everyone except the motionless procurator followed Mark Ratslayer\n\nwith their eyes as he motioned to the arrested man, indicating that he should\n\ngo with him.", "Everyone generally followed Ratslayer with their eyes\n\nwherever he appeared, because of his height, and those who were seeing\n\nhim for the first time also because the centurion\u2019s face was disfigured: his\n\nnose had once been smashed by a blow from a Germanic club.", "Mark\u2019s heavy boots thudded across the mosaic, the bound man\n\nnoiselessly went out with him, complete silence fell in the colonnade, and\n\none could hear pigeons cooing on the garden terrace near the balcony and\n\nwater singing an intricate, pleasant song in the fountain.", "The procurator would have liked to get up, put his temple under the\n\nspout, and stay standing that way.", "But he knew that even that would not\n\nhelp him.", "Having brought the arrested man from under the columns out to the\n\ngarden, Ratslayer took a whip from the hands of a legionary who was\n\nstanding at the foot of a bronze statue and, swinging easily, struck the\n\narrested man across the shoulders.", "The centurion\u2019s movement was casual\n\nand light, yet the bound man instantly collapsed on the ground as if his legs\n\nhad been cut from under him; he gasped for air, the colour drained from his\n\nface, and his eyes went vacant.", "With his left hand only, Mark heaved the fallen man into the air like an\n\nempty sack, set him on his feet, and spoke nasally, in poorly pronounced\n\nAramaic:\n\n\u2018The Roman procurator is called Hegemon.10 Use no other words.", "Stand\n\nat attention.", "Do you understand me, or do I hit you?\u2019\n\nThe arrested man swayed, but got hold of himself, his colour returned, he\n\ncaught his breath and answered hoarsely:\n\n\u2018I understand.", "Don\u2019t beat me.\u2019\n\nA moment later he was again standing before the procurator.", "A lustreless, sick voice sounded:\n\n\u2018Name?\u2019\n\n\u2018Mine?\u2019 the arrested man hastily responded, his whole being expressing a\n\nreadiness to answer sensibly, without provoking further wrath.", "The procurator said softly:\n\n\u2018I know my own.", "Don\u2019t pretend to be stupider than you are.", "Yours.\u2019\n\n\u2018Yeshua,\u201911 the prisoner replied promptly.", "\u2018Any surname?\u2019\n\n\u2018Ha-Nozri.\u2019\n\n\u2018Where do you come from?\u2019\n\n\u2018The town of Gamala,\u201912 replied the prisoner, indicating with his head\n\nthat there, somewhere far off to his right, in the north, was the town of\n\nGamala.", "\u2018Who are you by blood?\u2019\n\n\u2018I don\u2019t know exactly,\u2019 the arrested man replied animatedly, \u2018I don\u2019t\n\nremember my parents.", "I was told that my father was a Syrian ...\u2019\n\n\u2018Where is your permanent residence?\u2019\n\n\u2018I have no permanent home,\u2019 the prisoner answered shyly, \u2018I travel from\n\ntown to town.\u2019\n\n\u2018That can be put more briefly, in a word \u2014 a vagrant,\u2019 the procurator\n\nsaid, and asked:\n\n\u2018Any family?\u2019\n\n\u2018None.", "I\u2019m alone in the world.\u2019\n\n\u2018Can you read and write?\u2019\n\n\u2018Yes.\u2019\n\n\u2018Do you know any language besides Aramaic?\u2019\n\n\u2018Yes.", "Greek.\u2019\n\nA swollen eyelid rose, an eye clouded with suffering fixed the arrested\n\nman.", "The other eye remained shut.", "Pilate spoke in Greek.", "\u2018So it was you who was going to destroy the temple building and called\n\non the people to do that?\u2019\n\nHere the prisoner again became animated, his eyes ceased to show fear,\n\nand he spoke in Greek:\n\n\u2018Never, goo ...\u2019 Here terror flashed in the prisoner\u2019s eyes, because he had\n\nnearly made a slip.", "\u2018Never, Hegemon, never in my life was I going to\n\ndestroy the temple building, nor did I incite anyone to this senseless act.\u2019\n\nSurprise showed on the face of the secretary, hunched over a low table\n\nand writing down the testimony.", "He raised his head, but immediately bent it\n\nto the parchment again.", "\u2018All sorts of people gather in this town for the feast.", "Among them there\n\nare magicians, astrologers, diviners and murderers,\u2019 the procurator spoke in\n\nmonotone, \u2018and occasionally also liars.", "You, for instance, are a liar.", "It is\n\nwritten clearly: \u201cIncited to destroy the temple\u201d.", "People have testified to it.\u2019\n\n\u2018These good people,\u2019 the prisoner spoke and, hastily adding \u2018Hegemon\u2019,\n\nwent on: \u2018... haven\u2019t any learning and have confused everything I told them.", "Generally, I\u2019m beginning to be afraid that this confusion may go on for a\n\nvery long time.", "And all because he writes down the things I say incorrectly.\u2019\n\nSilence fell.", "By now both sick eyes rested heavily on the prisoner.", "\u2018I repeat to you, but for the last time, stop pretending that you\u2019re a\n\nmadman, robber,\u2019 Pilate said softly and monotonously, \u2018there\u2019s not much\n\nwritten in your record, but what there is is enough to hang you.\u2019\n\n\u2018No, no, Hegemon,\u2019 the arrested man said, straining all over in his wish\n\nto convince, \u2018there\u2019s one with a goatskin parchment who follows me,\n\nfollows me and keeps writing all the time.", "But once I peeked into this\n\nparchment and was horrified.", "I said decidedly nothing of what\u2019s written\n\nthere.", "I implored him: \u201cBurn your parchment, I beg you!\u201d But he tore it out\n\nof my hands and ran away.\u2019\n\n\u2018Who is that?\u2019 Pilate asked squeamishly and touched his temple with his\n\nhand.", "\u2018Matthew Levi,\u201913 the prisoner explained willingly.", "\u2018He used to be a tax\n\ncollector, and I first met him on the road in Bethphage, 14 where a fig grove\n\njuts out at an angle, and I got to talking with him.", "He treated me hostilely at\n\nfirst and even insulted me \u2014 that is, thought he insulted me - by calling me\n\na dog.\u2019 Here the prisoner smiled.", "\u2018I personally see nothing bad about this\n\nanimal, that I should be offended by this word ...\u2019\n\nThe secretary stopped writing and stealthily cast a surprised glance, not\n\nat the arrested man, but at the procurator.", "\u2018...", "However, after listening to me, he began to soften,\u2019 Yeshua went on,\n\n\u2018finally threw the money down in the road and said he would go journeying\n\nwith me ...\u2019\n\nPilate grinned with one cheek, baring yellow teeth, and said, turning his\n\nwhole body towards the secretary:\n\n\u2018Oh, city of Yershalaim!", "What does one not hear in it!", "A tax collector, do\n\nyou hear, threw money down in the road!\u2019\n\nNot knowing how to reply to that, the secretary found it necessary to\n\nrepeat Pilate\u2019s smile.", "\u2018He said that henceforth money had become hateful to him,\u2019 Yeshua\n\nexplained Matthew Levi\u2019s strange action and added: \u2018And since then he has\n\nbeen my companion.\u2019\n\nHis teeth still bared, the procurator glanced at the arrested man, then at\n\nthe sun, steadily rising over the equestrian statues of the hippodrome, which\n\nlay far below to the right, and suddenly, in some sickening anguish, thought\n\nthat the simplest thing would be to drive this strange robber off the balcony\n\nby uttering just two words: \u2018Hang him.\u2019 To drive the convoy away as well,\n\nto leave the colonnade, go into the palace, order the room darkened,\n\ncollapse on the bed, send for cold water, call in a plaintive voice for his dog\n\nBanga, and complain to him about the hemicrania.", "And the thought of\n\npoison suddenly flashed temptingly in the procurator\u2019s sick head.", "He gazed with dull eyes at the arrested man and was silent for a time,\n\npainfully trying to remember why there stood before him in the pitiless\n\nmorning sunlight of Yershalaim this prisoner with his face disfigured by\n\nbeating, and what other utterly unnecessary questions he had to ask him.", "\u2018Matthew Levi?\u2019 the sick man asked in a hoarse voice and dosed his\n\neyes.", "\u2018Yes, Matthew Levi,\u2019 the high, tormenting voice came to him.", "\u2018And what was it in any case that you said about the temple to the crowd\n\nin the bazaar?\u2019\n\nThe responding voice seemed to stab at Pilate\u2019s temple, was\n\ninexpressibly painful, and this voice was saying:\n\n\u2018I said, Hegemon, that the temple of the old faith would fall and a new\n\ntemple of truth would be built.", "I said it that way so as to make it more\n\nunderstandable.\u2019\n\n\u2018And why did you stir up the people in the bazaar, you vagrant, talking\n\nabout the truth, of which you have no notion?", "What is truth?\u201915\n\nAnd here the procurator thought: \u2018Oh, my gods!", "I\u2019m asking him about\n\nsomething unnecessary at a trial ... my reason no longer serves me ...\u2019 And\n\nagain he pictured a cup of dark liquid.", "\u2018Poison, bring me poison ...\u2019\n\nAnd again he heard the voice:\n\nThe truth is, first of all, that your head aches, and aches so badly that\n\nyou\u2019re having faint-hearted thoughts of death.", "You\u2019re not only unable to\n\nspeak to me, but it is even hard for you to look at me.", "And I am now your\n\nunwilling torturer, which upsets me.", "You can\u2019t even think about anything\n\nand only dream that your dog should come, apparently the one being you\n\nare attached to.", "But your suffering will soon be over, your headache will go\n\naway.\u2018\n\nThe secretary goggled his eyes at the prisoner and stopped writing in\n\nmid-word.", "Pilate raised his tormented eyes to the prisoner and saw that the sun\n\nalready stood quite high over the hippodrome, that a ray had penetrated the\n\ncolonnade and was stealing towards Yeshua\u2019s worn sandals, and that the\n\nman was trying to step out of the sun\u2019s way.", "Here the procurator rose from his chair, clutched his head with his hands,\n\nand his yellowish, shaven face expressed dread.", "But he instantly suppressed\n\nit with his will and lowered himself into his chair again.", "The prisoner meanwhile continued his speech, but the secretary was no\n\nlonger writing it down, and only stretched his neck like a goose, trying not\n\nto let drop a single word.", "\u2018Well, there, it\u2019s all over,\u2019 the arrested man said, glancing benevolently at\n\nPilate, \u2018and I\u2019m extremely glad of it.", "I\u2019d advise you, Hegemon, to leave the\n\npalace for a while and go for a stroll somewhere in the vicinity \u2014 say, in\n\nthe gardens on the Mount of Olives.16 A storm will come ...\u2019 the prisoner\n\nturned, narrowing his eyes at the sun, \u2018... later on, towards evening.", "A stroll\n\nwould do you much good, and I would be glad to accompany you.", "Certain\n\nnew thoughts have occurred to me, which I think you might find interesting,\n\nand I\u2019d willingly share them with you, the more so as you give the\n\nimpression of being a very intelligent man.\u2019\n\nThe secretary turned deathly pale and dropped the scroll on the floor.", "The trouble is,\u2018 the bound man went on, not stopped by anyone, \u2019hat you\n\nare too closed off and have definitively lost faith in people.", "You must agree, one can\u2019t place all one\u2019s affection in a dog.", "Your life is\n\nimpoverished, Hegemon.\u2018 And here the speaker allowed himself to smile.", "The secretary now thought of only one thing, whether to believe his ears\n\nor not.", "He had to believe.", "Then he tried to imagine precisely what\n\nwhimsical form the wrath of the hot-tempered procurator would take at this\n\nunheard-of impudence from the prisoner.", "And this the secretary was unable\n\nto imagine, though he knew the procurator well.", "Then came the cracked, hoarse voice of the procurator, who said in Latin:\n\n\u2018Unbind his hands.\u2019\n\nOne of the convoy legionaries rapped with his spear, handed it to another,\n\nwent over and took the ropes off the prisoner.", "The secretary picked up his\n\nscroll, having decided to record nothing for now, and to be surprised at\n\nnothing.", "\u2018Admit,\u2019 Pilate asked softly in Greek, \u2018that you are a great physician?\u2019\n\n\u2018No, Procurator, I am not a physician,\u2019 the prisoner replied, delightedly\n\nrubbing a crimped and swollen purple wrist.", "Scowling deeply, Pilate bored the prisoner with his eyes, and these eyes\n\nwere no longer dull, but flashed with sparks familiar to all.", "\u2018I didn\u2019t ask you,\u2019 Pilate said, \u2018maybe you also know Latin?\u2019\n\n\u2018Yes, I do,\u2019 the prisoner replied.", "Colour came to Pilate\u2019s yellowish cheeks, and he asked in Latin:\n\n\u2018How did you know I wanted to call my dog?\u2019\n\n\u2018It\u2019s very simple,\u2019 the prisoner replied in Latin.", "\u2018You were moving your\n\nhand in the air\u2019 \u2014 and the prisoner repeated Pilate\u2019s gesture \u2014 \u2019as if you\n\nwanted to stroke something, and your lips ...\u2018\n\n\u2018Yes,\u2019 said Pilate.", "There was silence.", "Then Pilate asked a question in Greek:\n\n\u2018And so, you are a physician?\u2019\n\n\u2018No, no,\u2019 the prisoner replied animatedly, \u2018believe me, I\u2019m not a\n\nphysician.\u2019\n\n\u2018Very well, then, if you want to keep it a secret, do so.", "It has no direct\n\nbearing on the case.", "So you maintain that you did not incite anyone to\n\ndestroy ... or set fire to, or in any other way demolish the temple?\u2019\n\n\u2018I repeat, I did not incite anyone to such acts, Hegemon.", "Do I look like a\n\nhalfwit?\u2019\n\n\u2018Oh, no, you don\u2019t look like a halfwit,\u2019 the procurator replied quietly and\n\nsmiled some strange smile.", "\u2018Swear, then, that it wasn\u2019t so.\u2019\n\n\u2018By what do you want me to swear?\u2019 the unbound man asked, very\n\nanimated.", "\u2018Well, let\u2019s say, by your life,\u2019 the procurator replied.", "\u2018It\u2019s high time you\n\nswore by it, since it\u2019s hanging by a hair, I can tell you.\u2019\n\n\u2018You don\u2019t think it was you who hung it, Hegemon?\u2019 the prisoner asked.", "\u2018If so, you are very mistaken.\u2019\n\nPilate gave a start and replied through his teeth:\n\n\u2018I can cut that hair.\u2019\n\n\u2018In that, too, you are mistaken,\u2019 the prisoner retorted, smiling brightly\n\nand shielding himself from the sun with his hand.", "\u2018You must agree that\n\nsurely only he who hung it can cut the hair?\u2019\n\n\u2018So, so,\u2019 Pilate said, smiling, \u2018now I have no doubts that the idle loafers\n\nof Yershalaim followed at your heels.", "I don\u2019t know who hung such a tongue\n\non you, but he hung it well.", "Incidentally, tell me, is it true that you entered\n\nYershalaim by the Susa gate17 riding on an ass,18 accompanied by a crowd\n\nof riff-raff who shouted greetings to you as some kind of prophet?\u2019 Here the\n\nprocurator pointed to the parchment scroll.", "The prisoner glanced at the procurator in perplexity.", "\u2018I don\u2019t even have an ass, Hegemon,\u2019 he said.", "\u2018I did enter Yershalaim by\n\nthe Susa gate, but on foot, accompanied only by Matthew Levi, and no one\n\nshouted anything to me, because no one in Yershalaim knew me then.\u2019\n\n\u2018Do you happen to know,\u2019 Pilate continued without taking his eyes off\n\nthe prisoner, \u2018such men as a certain Dysmas, another named Gestas, and a\n\nthird named Bar-Rabban?\u201919\n\n\u2018I do not know these good people,\u2019 the prisoner replied.", "\u2018Truly?\u2019\n\n\u2018Truly.\u2019\n\n\u2018And now tell me, why is it that you use the words \u201cgood people\u201d all the\n\ntime?", "Do you call everyone that, or what?\u2019\n\n\u2018Everyone,\u2019 the prisoner replied.", "\u2018There are no evil people in the world.\u2019\n\n\u2018The first I hear of it,\u2019 Pilate said, grinning.", "\u2018But perhaps I know too little\n\nof life!", "... You needn\u2019t record any more,\u2019 he addressed the secretary, who\n\nhad not recorded anything anyway, and went on talking with the prisoner.", "\u2018You read that in some Greek book?\u2019\n\n\u2018No, I figured it out for myself.\u2019\n\n\u2018And you preach it?\u2019\n\n\u2018Yes.\u2019\n\n\u2018But take, for instance, the centurion Mark, the one known as Ratslayer -\n\nis he good?\u2019\n\n\u2018Yes,\u2019 replied the prisoner.", "\u2018True, he\u2019s an unhappy man.", "Since the good\n\npeople disfigured him, he has become cruel and hard.", "I\u2019d be curious to\n\nknow who maimed him.\u2019\n\n\u2018I can willingly tell you that,\u2019 Pilate responded, \u2018for I was a witness to it.", "The good people fell on him like dogs on a bear.", "There were Germani\n\nfastened on his neck, his arms, his legs.", "The infantry maniple was encircled,\n\nand if one flank hadn\u2019t been cut by a cavalry turm, of which I was the\n\ncommander \u2014 you, philosopher, would not have had the chance to speak\n\nwith the Ratslayer.", "That was at the battle of Idistaviso, 20 in the Valley of the\n\nVirgins.\u2019\n\n\u2018If I could speak with him,\u2019 the prisoner suddenly said musingly, \u2018I\u2019m\n\nsure he\u2019d change sharply.\u2019\n\n\u2018I don\u2019t suppose,\u2019 Pilate responded, \u2018that you\u2019d bring much joy to the\n\nlegate of the legion if you decided to talk with any of his officers or\n\nsoldiers.", "Anyhow, it\u2019s also not going to happen, fortunately for everyone,\n\nand I will be the first to see to it.\u2019\n\nAt that moment a swallow swiftly flitted into the colonnade, described a\n\ncircle under the golden ceiling, swooped down, almost brushed the face of a\n\nbronze statue in a niche with its pointed wing, and disappeared behind the\n\ncapital of a column.", "It may be that it thought of nesting there.", "During its flight, a formula took shape in the now light and lucid head of\n\nthe procurator.", "It went like this: the hegemon has looked into the case of the\n\nvagrant philosopher Yeshua, alias Ha-Nozri, and found in it no grounds for\n\nindictment.", "In particular, he has found not the slightest connection between\n\nthe acts of Yeshua and the disorders that have lately taken place in\n\nYershalaim.", "The vagrant philosopher has proved to be mentally ill.\n\nConsequently, the procurator has not confirmed the death sentence on Ha-\n\nNozri passed by the Lesser Sanhedrin.", "But seeing that Ha-Nozri\u2019s mad\n\nutopian talk might cause disturbances in Yershalaim, the procurator is\n\nremoving Yeshua from Yershalaim and putting him under confinement in\n\nStratonian Caesarea on the Mediterranean \u2014 that is, precisely where the\n\nprocurator\u2019s residence was.", "It remained to dictate it to the secretary.", "The swallow\u2019s wings whiffled right over the hegemon\u2019s head, the bird\n\ndarted to the fountain basin and then flew out into freedom.", "The procurator\n\nraised his eyes to the prisoner and saw the dust blaze up in a pillar around\n\nhim.", "\u2018Is that all about him?\u2019 Pilate asked the secretary.", "\u2018Unfortunately not,\u2019 the secretary replied unexpectedly and handed Pilate\n\nanother piece of parchment.", "\u2018What\u2019s this now?\u2019 Pilate asked and frowned.", "Having read what had been handed to him, he changed countenance even\n\nmore.", "Either the dark blood rose to his neck and face, or something else\n\nhappened, only his skin lost its yellow tinge, turned brown, and his eyes\n\nseemed to sink.", "Again it was probably owing to the blood rising to his temples and\n\nthrobbing in them, only something happened to the procurator\u2019s vision.", "Thus, he imagined that the prisoner\u2019s head floated off somewhere, and\n\nanother appeared in its place.21 On this bald head sat a scant-pointed golden\n\ndiadem.", "On the forehead was a round canker, eating into the skin and\n\nsmeared with ointment.", "A sunken, toothless mouth with a pendulous,\n\ncapricious lower lip.", "It seemed to Pilate that the pink columns of the\n\nbalcony and the rooftops of Yershalaim far below, beyond the garden,\n\nvanished, and everything was drowned in the thickest green of Caprean\n\ngardens.", "And something strange also happened to his hearing: it was as if\n\ntrumpets sounded far away, muted and menacing, and a nasal voice was\n\nvery clearly heard, arrogantly drawling: \u2018The law of lese-majesty ...\u2019\n\nThoughts raced, short, incoherent and extraordinary: \u2018I\u2019m lost!", "...\u2019 then:\n\n\u2018We\u2019re lost!", "...\u2019 And among them a totally absurd one, about some\n\nimmortality, which immortality for some reason provoked unendurable\n\nanguish.", "Pilate strained, drove the apparition away, his gaze returned to the\n\nbalcony, and again the prisoner\u2019s eyes were before him.", "\u2018Listen, Ha-Nozri,\u2019 the procurator spoke, looking at Yeshua somehow\n\nstrangely: the procurator\u2019s face was menacing, but his eyes were alarmed,\n\n\u2018did you ever say anything about the great Caesar?", "Answer!", "Did you?", "...", "Yes ... or ... no?\u2019 Pilate drew the word \u2018no\u2019 out somewhat longer than is\n\ndone in court, and his glance sent Yeshua some thought that he wished as if\n\nto instil in the prisoner.", "\u2018To speak the truth is easy and pleasant,\u2019 the prisoner observed.", "\u2018I have no need to know,\u2019 Pilate responded in a stifled, angry voice,\n\n\u2018whether it is pleasant or unpleasant for you to speak the truth.", "You will\n\nhave to speak it anyway.", "But, as you speak, weigh every word, unless you\n\nwant a not only inevitable but also painful death.\u2019\n\nNo one knew what had happened with the procurator of Judea, but he\n\nallowed himself to raise his hand as if to protect himself from a ray of\n\nsunlight, and from behind his hand, as from behind a shield, to send the\n\nprisoner some sort of prompting look.", "\u2018Answer, then,\u2019 he went on speaking, \u2018do you know a certain Judas from\n\nKiriath, 22 and what precisely did you say to him about Caesar, if you said\n\nanything?\u2019\n\n\u2018It was like this,\u2019 the prisoner began talking eagerly.", "\u2018The evening before\n\nlast, near the temple, I made the acquaintance of a young man who called\n\nhimself Judas, from the town of Kiriath.", "He invited me to his place in the\n\nLower City and treated me to ...\u2019\n\n\u2018A good man?\u2019 Pilate asked, and a devilish fire flashed in his eyes.", "\u2018A very good man and an inquisitive one,\u2019 the prisoner confirmed.", "\u2018He\n\nshowed the greatest interest in my thoughts and received me very cordially\n\n...\u2019\n\n\u2018Lit the lamps ...\u201923 Pilate spoke through his teeth, in the same tone as the\n\nprisoner, and his eyes glinted.", "\u2018Yes,\u2019 Yeshua went on, slightly surprised that the procurator was so well\n\ninformed, \u2018and asked me to give my view of state authority.", "He was\n\nextremely interested in this question.\u2019\n\n\u2018And what did you say?\u2019 asked Pilate.", "\u2018Or are you going to reply that\n\nyou\u2019ve forgotten what you said?\u2019 But there was already hopelessness in\n\nPilate\u2019s tone.", "\u2018Among other things,\u2019 the prisoner recounted, \u2018I said that all authority is\n\nviolence over people, and that a time will come when there will be no\n\nauthority of the Caesars, nor any other authority.", "Man will pass into the\n\nkingdom of truth and justice, where generally there will be no need for any\n\nauthority.\u2019\n\n\u2018Go on!\u2019\n\n\u2018I didn\u2019t go on,\u2019 said the prisoner.", "\u2018Here men ran in, bound me, and took\n\nme away to prison.\u2019\n\nThe secretary, trying not to let drop a single word, rapidly traced the\n\nwords on his parchment.", "\u2018There never has been, is not, and never will be any authority in this\n\nworld greater or better for people than the authority of the emperor\n\nTiberius!\u2019 Pilate\u2019s cracked and sick voice swelled.", "For some reason the\n\nprocurator looked at the secretary and the convoy with hatred.", "\u2018And it is not for you, insane criminal, to reason about it!\u2019 Here Pilate\n\nshouted: \u2018Convoy, off the balcony!\u2019 And turning to the secretary, he added:\n\n\u2018Leave me alone with the criminal, this is a state matter!\u2019\n\nThe convoy raised their spears and with a measured tramp of hob-nailed\n\ncaligae walked off the balcony into the garden, and the secretary followed\n\nthe convoy.", "For some time the silence on the balcony was broken only by the water\n\nsinging in the fountain.", "Pilate saw how the watery dish blew up over the\n\nspout, how its edges broke off, how it fell down in streams.", "The prisoner was the first to speak.", "\u2018I see that some misfortune has come about because I talked with that\n\nyoung man from Kiriath.", "I have a foreboding, Hegemon, that he will come\n\nto grief, and I am very sorry for him.\u2019\n\n\u2018I think,\u2019 the procurator replied, grinning strangely, \u2018that there is now\n\nsomeone else in the world for whom you ought to feel sorrier than for Judas\n\nof Kiriath, and who is going to have it much worse than Judas!", "...", "So, then,\n\nMark Ratslayer, a cold and convinced torturer, the people who, as I see,\u2019 the\n\nprocurator pointed to Yeshua\u2019s disfigured face, \u2018beat you for your\n\npreaching, the robbers Dysmas and Gestas, who with their confr\u00e8res killed\n\nfour soldiers, and, finally, the dirty traitor Judas \u2014 are all good people?\u2019\n\n\u2018Yes,\u2019 said the prisoner.", "\u2018And the kingdom of truth will come?\u2019\n\n\u2018It will, Hegemon,\u2019 Yeshua answered with conviction.", "\u2018It will never come!\u2019 Pilate suddenly cried out in such a terrible voice\n\nthat Yeshua drew back.", "Thus, many years before, in the Valley of the\n\nVirgins, Pilate had cried to his horsemen the words: \u2018Cut them down!", "Cut\n\nthem down!", "The giant Ratslayer is trapped!\u2019 He raised his voice, cracked\n\nwith commanding, still more, and called out so that his words could be\n\nheard in the garden: \u2018Criminal!", "Criminal!", "Criminal!\u2019 And then, lowering his\n\nvoice, he asked: \u2018Yeshua Ha-Nozri, do you believe in any gods?\u2019\n\n\u2018God is one,\u2019 replied Yeshua, \u2018I believe in him.\u2019\n\n\u2018Then pray to him!", "Pray hard!", "However ...\u2019 here Pilate\u2019s voice gave out,\n\n\u2018that won\u2019t help.", "No wife?\u2019 Pilate asked with anguish for some reason, not\n\nunderstanding what was happening to him.", "\u2018No, I\u2019m alone.\u2019\n\n\u2018Hateful city ...\u2019 the procurator suddenly muttered for some reason,\n\nshaking his shoulders as if he were cold, and rubbing his hands as though\n\nwashing them, \u2018if they\u2019d put a knife in you before your meeting with Judas\n\nof Kiriath, it really would have been better.\u2019\n\n\u2018Why don\u2019t you let me go, Hegemon?\u2019 the prisoner asked unexpectedly,\n\nand his voice became anxious.", "\u2018I see they want to kill me.\u2019\n\nA spasm contorted Pilate\u2019s face, he turned to Yeshua the inflamed, red-\n\nveined whites of his eyes and said:\n\n\u2018Do you suppose, wretch, that the Roman procurator will let a man go\n\nwho has said what you have said?", "Oh, gods, gods!", "Or do you think I\u2019m\n\nready to take your place?", "I don\u2019t share your thoughts!", "And listen to me: if\n\nfrom this moment on you say even one word, if you speak to anyone at all,\n\nbeware of me!", "I repeat to you \u2014 beware!\u2019\n\n\u2018Hegemon...\u2019\n\n\u2018Silence!\u2019 cried Pilate, and his furious gaze followed the swallow that\n\nhad again fluttered on to the balcony.", "\u2018To me!\u2019 Pilate shouted.", "And when the secretary and the convoy returned to their places, Pilate\n\nannounced that he confirmed the death sentence passed at the meeting of\n\nthe Lesser Sanhedrin on the criminal Yeshua Ha-Nozri, and the secretary\n\nwrote down what Pilate said.", "A moment later Mark Ratslayer stood before the procurator.", "The\n\nprocurator ordered him to hand the criminal over to the head of the secret\n\nservice, along with the procurator\u2019s directive that Yeshua Ha-Nozri was to\n\nbe separated from the other condemned men, and also that the soldiers of\n\nthe secret service were to be forbidden, on pain of severe punishment, to\n\ntalk with Yeshua about anything at all or to answer any of his questions.", "At a sign from Mark, the convoy closed around Yeshua and led him from\n\nthe balcony.", "Next there stood before the procurator a handsome, light-bearded man\n\nwith eagle feathers on the crest of his helmet, golden lions\u2019 heads shining\n\non his chest, and golden plaques on his sword belt, wearing triple-soled\n\nboots laced to the knees, and with a purple cloak thrown over his left\n\nshoulder.", "This was the legate in command of the legion.", "The procurator asked him where the Sebastean cohort was stationed at\n\nthe moment.", "The legate told him that the Sebasteans had cordoned off the\n\nsquare in front of the hippodrome, where the sentencing of the criminals\n\nwas to be announced to the people.", "Then the procurator ordered the legate to detach two centuries from the\n\nRoman cohort.", "One of them, under the command of Ratslayer, was to\n\nconvoy the criminals, the carts with the implements for the execution and\n\nthe executioners as they were transported to Bald Mountain, 24 and on\n\narrival was to join the upper cordon.", "The other was to be sent at once to\n\nBald Mountain and immediately start forming the cordon.", "For the same\n\npurpose, that is, to guard the mountain, the procurator asked the legate to\n\nsend an auxiliary cavalry regiment \u2014 the Syrian ala.\n\nAfter the legate left the balcony, the procurator ordered the secretary to\n\nsummon to the palace the president of the Sanhedrin, two of its members,\n\nand the head of the temple guard in Yershalaim, adding that he asked things\n\nto be so arranged that before conferring with all these people, he could\n\nspeak with the president previously and alone.", "The procurator\u2019s order was executed quickly and precisely, and the sun,\n\nwhich in those days was scorching Yershalaim with an extraordinary\n\nfierceness, had not yet had time to approach its highest point when, on the\n\nupper terrace of the garden, by the two white marble lions that guarded the\n\nstairs, a meeting took place between the procurator and the man fulfilling\n\nthe duties of president of the Sanhedrin, the high priest of the Jews, Joseph\n\nKaifa.25\n\nIt was quiet in the garden.", "But when he came out from under the\n\ncolonnade to the sun-drenched upper level of the garden with its palm trees\n\non monstrous elephant legs, from which there spread before the procurator\n\nthe whole of hateful Yershalaim, with its hanging bridges, fortresses, and,\n\nabove all, that utterly indescribable heap of marble with golden dragon\n\nscales for a roof \u2014 the temple of Yershalaim \u2014 the procurator\u2019s sharp ear\n\ncaught, far below, where the stone wall separated the lower terraces of the\n\npalace garden from the city square, a low rumble over which from time to\n\ntime there soared feeble, thin moans or cries.", "The procurator understood that there, on the square, a numberless crowd\n\nof Yershalaim citizens, agitated by the recent disorders, had already\n\ngathered, that this crowd was waiting impatiently for the announcement of\n\nthe sentences, and that restless water sellers were crying in its midst.", "The procurator began by inviting the high priest on to the balcony, to take\n\nshelter from the merciless heat, but Kaifa politely apologized26 and\n\nexplained that he could not do that on the eve of the feast.", "Pilate covered his\n\nslightly balding head with a hood and began the conversation.", "This\n\nconversation took place in Greek.", "Pilate said that he had looked into the case of Yeshua Ha-Nozri and\n\nconfirmed the death sentence.", "Thus, three robbers - Dysmas, Gestas and Bar-Rabban \u2014 and this Yeshua\n\nHa-Nozri besides, were condemned to be executed, and it was to be done\n\nthat day.", "The first two, who had ventured to incite the people to rebel\n\nagainst Caesar, had been taken in armed struggle by the Roman authorities,\n\nwere accounted to the procurator, and, consequently, would not be talked\n\nabout here.", "But the second two, Bar-Rabban and Ha-Nozri, had been seized\n\nby the local authorities and condemned by the Sanhedrin.", "According to the\n\nlaw, according to custom, one of these two criminals had to be released in\n\nhonour of the great feast of Passover, which would begin that day.", "And so\n\nthe procurator wished to know which of the two criminals the Sanhedrin\n\nintended to set free: Bar-Rabban or Ha-Nozri?27\n\nKaifa inclined his head to signify that the question was clear to him, and\n\nreplied:\n\n\u2018The Sanhedrin asks that Bar-Rabban be released.\u2019\n\nThe procurator knew very well that the high priest would give precisely\n\nthat answer, but his task consisted in showing that this answer provoked his\n\nastonishment.", "This Pilate did with great artfulness.", "The eyebrows on the arrogant face\n\nrose, the procurator looked with amazement straight into the high priest\u2019s\n\neyes.", "\u2018I confess, this answer stuns me,\u2019 the procurator began softly, \u2018I\u2019m afraid\n\nthere may be some misunderstanding here.\u2019\n\nPilate explained himself.", "Roman authority does not encroach in the least\n\nupon the rights of the local spiritual authorities, the high priest knows that\n\nvery well, but in the present case we are faced with an obvious error.", "And\n\nthis error Roman authority is, of course, interested in correcting.", "In fact, the crimes of Bar-Rabban and Ha-Nozri are quite incomparable in\n\ntheir gravity.", "If the latter, obviously an insane person, is guilty of uttering\n\npreposterous things in Yershalaim and some other places, the former\u2019s\n\nburden of guilt is more considerable.", "Not only did he allow himself to call\n\ndirectly for rebellion, but he also killed a guard during the attempt to arrest\n\nhim.", "Bar-Rabban is incomparably more dangerous than Ha-Nozri.", "On the strength of all the foregoing, the procurator asks the high priest to\n\nreconsider the decision and release the less harmful of the two condemned\n\nmen, and that is without doubt Ha-Nozri.", "And so?...", "Kaifa said in a quiet but firm voice that the Sanhedrin had thoroughly\n\nfamiliarized itself with the case and informed him a second time that it\n\nintended to free Bar-Rabban.", "\u2018What?", "Even after my intercession?", "The intercession of him through\n\nwhose person Roman authority speaks?", "Repeat it a third time, High Priest.\u2019\n\n\u2018And a third time I repeat that we are setting Bar-Rabban free,\u2019 Kaifa said\n\nsoftly.", "It was all over, and there was nothing more to talk about.", "Ha-Nozri was\n\ndeparting for ever, and there was no one to cure the dreadful, wicked pains\n\nof the procurator, there was no remedy for them except death.", "But it was not\n\nthis thought which now struck Pilate.", "The same incomprehensible anguish\n\nthat had already visited him on the balcony pierced his whole being.", "He\n\ntried at once to explain it, and the explanation was a strange one: it seemed\n\nvaguely to the procurator that there was something he had not finished\n\nsaying to the condemned man, and perhaps something he had not finished\n\nhearing.", "Pilate drove this thought away, and it flew off as instantly as it had come\n\nflying.", "It flew off, and the anguish remained unexplained, for it could not\n\nwell be explained by another brief thought that flashed like lightning and at\n\nonce went out \u2014 \u2018Immortality ... immortality has come ...\u2019 Whose\n\nimmortality had come?", "That the procurator did not understand, but the\n\nthought of this enigmatic immortality made him grow cold in the scorching\n\nsun.", "\u2018Very well,\u2019 said Pilate, \u2018let it be so.\u2019\n\nHere he turned, gazed around at the world visible to him, and was\n\nsurprised at the change that had taken place.", "The bush laden with roses had\n\nvanished, vanished were the cypresses bordering the upper terrace, and the\n\npomegranate tree, and the white statue amidst the greenery, and the\n\ngreenery itself.", "In place of it all there floated some purple mass, 28 water\n\nweeds swayed in it and began moving off somewhere, and Pilate himself\n\nbegan moving with them.", "He was carried along now, smothered and burned,\n\nby the most terrible wrath \u2014 the wrath of impotence.", "\u2018Cramped,\u2019 said Pilate, \u2018I feel cramped!\u2019\n\nWith a cold, moist hand he tore at the clasp on the collar of his cloak, and\n\nit fell to the sand.", "\u2018It\u2019s sultry today, there\u2019s a storm somewhere,\u2019 Kaifa responded, not\n\ntaking his eyes off the procurator\u2019s reddened face, and foreseeing all the\n\ntorments that still lay ahead, he thought: \u2018Oh, what a terrible month of\n\nNisan we\u2019re having this year!\u2019\n\n\u2018No,\u2019 said Pilate, \u2018it\u2019s not because of the sultriness, I feel cramped with\n\nyou here, Kaifa.\u2019 And, narrowing his eyes, Pilate smiled and added: \u2018Watch\n\nout for yourself, High Priest.\u2019\n\nThe high priest\u2019s dark eyes glinted, and with his face - no less artfully\n\nthan the procurator had done earlier \u2014 he expressed amazement.", "\u2018What do I hear, Procurator?\u2019 Kaifa replied proudly and calmly.", "\u2018You\n\nthreaten me after you yourself have confirmed the sentence passed?", "Can\n\nthat be?", "We are accustomed to the Roman procurator choosing his words\n\nbefore he says something.", "What if we should be overheard, Hegemon?\u2019\n\nPilate looked at the high priest with dead eyes and, baring his teeth,\n\nproduced a smile.", "\u2018What\u2019s your trouble, High Priest?", "Who can hear us where we are now?", "Do you think I\u2019m like that young vagrant holy fool who is to be executed\n\ntoday?", "Am I a boy, Kaifa?", "I know what I say and where I say it.", "There is a\n\ncordon around the garden, a cordon around the palace, so that a mouse\n\ncouldn\u2019t get through any crack!", "Not only a mouse, but even that one, what\u2019s\n\nhis name ... from the town of Kiriath, couldn\u2019t get through.", "Incidentally,\n\nHigh Priest, do you know him?", "Yes ... if that one got in here, he\u2019d feel\n\nbitterly sorry for himself, in this you will, of course, believe me?", "Know,\n\nthen, that from now on, High Priest, you will have no peace!", "Neither you\n\nnor your people\u2019 \u2014 and Pilate pointed far off to the right, where the temple\n\nblazed on high \u2014 \u2019it is I who tell you so, Pontius Pilate, equestrian of the\n\nGolden Spear!\u201829\n\n\u2018I know, I know!\u2019 the black-bearded Kaifa fearlessly replied, and his eyes\n\nflashed.", "He raised his arm to heaven and went on: \u2018The Jewish people know\n\nthat you hate them with a cruel hatred, and will cause them much suffering,\n\nbut you will not destroy them utterly!", "God will protect them!", "He will hear\n\nus, the almighty Caesar will hear, he will protect us from Pilate the\n\ndestroyer!\u2019\n\n\u2018Oh, no!\u2019 Pilate exclaimed, and he felt lighter and lighter with every\n\nword: there was no more need to pretend, no more need to choose his\n\nwords.", "\u2018You have complained about me too much to Caesar, and now my\n\nhour has come, Kaifa!", "Now the message will fly from me, and not to the\n\ngovernor in Antioch, and not to Rome, but directly to Capreae, to the\n\nemperor himself, the message of how you in Yershalaim are sheltering\n\nknown criminals from death.", "And then it will not be water from Solomon\u2019s\n\nPool that I give Yershalaim to drink, as I wanted to do for your own good!", "No, not water!", "Remember how on account of you I had to remove the\n\nshields with the emperor\u2019s insignia from the walls, had to transfer troops,\n\nhad, as you see, to come in person to look into what goes on with you here!", "Remember my words: it is not just one cohort that you will see here in\n\nYershalaim, High Priest - no!", "The whole Fulminata legion will come under\n\nthe city walls, the Arabian cavalry will arrive, and then you will hear bitter\n\nweeping and wailing!", "You will remember Bar-Rabban then, whom you\n\nsaved, and you will regret having sent to his death a philosopher with his\n\npeaceful preaching!\u2019\n\nThe high priest\u2019s face became covered with blotches, his eyes burned.", "Like the procurator, he smiled, baring his teeth, and replied:\n\n\u2018Do you yourself believe what you are saying now, Procurator?", "No, you\n\ndo not!", "It is not peace, not peace, that the seducer of the people of\n\nYershalaim brought us, and you, equestrian, understand that perfectly well.", "You wanted to release him so that he could disturb the people, outrage the\n\nfaith, and bring the people under Roman swords!", "But I, the high priest of\n\nthe Jews, as long as I live, will not allow the faith to be outraged and will\n\nprotect the people!", "Do you hear, Pilate?\u2019 And Kaifa raised his arm\n\nmenacingly: \u2018Listen, Procurator!\u2019\n\nKaifa fell silent, and the procurator again heard a noise as if of the sea,\n\nrolling up to the very walls of the garden of Herod the Great.", "The noise rose\n\nfrom below to the feet and into the face of the procurator.", "And behind his\n\nback, there, beyond the wings of the palace, came alarming trumpet calls,\n\nthe heavy crunch of hundreds of feet, the clanking of iron.", "The procurator\n\nunderstood that the Roman infantry was already setting out, on his orders,\n\nspeeding to the parade of death so terrible for rebels and robbers.", "\u2018Do you hear, Procurator?\u2019 the high priest repeated quietly.", "\u2018Are you\n\ngoing to tell me that all this\u2019 \u2014 here the high priest raised both arms and\n\nthe dark hood fell from his head \u2014 \u2019as been caused by the wretched robber\n\nBar-Rabban?\u2018\n\nThe procurator wiped his wet, cold forehead with the back of his hand,\n\nlooked at the ground, then, squinting at the sky, saw that the red-hot ball\n\nwas almost over his head and that Kaifa\u2019s shadow had shrunk to nothing by\n\nthe lion\u2019s tail, and said quietly and indifferently:\n\n\u2018It\u2019s nearly noon.", "We got carried away by our conversation, and yet we\n\nmust proceed.\u2019\n\nHaving apologized in refined terms before the high priest, he invited him\n\nto sit down on a bench in the shade of a magnolia and wait until he\n\nsummoned the other persons needed for the last brief conference and gave\n\none more instruction connected with the execution.", "Kaifa bowed politely, placing his hand on his heart, and stayed in the\n\ngarden while Pilate returned to the balcony.", "There he told the secretary, who\n\nhad been waiting for him, to invite to the garden the legate of the legion and\n\nthe tribune of the cohort, as well as the two members of the Sanhedrin and\n\nthe head of the temple guard, who had been awaiting his summons on the\n\nlower garden terrace, in a round gazebo with a fountain.", "To this Pilate\n\nadded that he himself would come out to the garden at once, and withdrew\n\ninto the palace.", "While the secretary was gathering the conference, the procurator met, in\n\na room shielded from the sun by dark curtains, with a certain man, whose\n\nface was half covered by a hood, though he could not have been bothered\n\nby the sun\u2019s rays in this room.", "The meeting was a very short one.", "The\n\nprocurator quietly spoke a few words to the man, after which he withdrew\n\nand Pilate walked out through the colonnade to the garden.", "There, in the presence of all those he had desired to see, the procurator\n\nsolemnly and drily stated that he confirmed the death sentence on Yeshua\n\nHa-Nozri, and officially inquired of the members of the Sanhedrin as to\n\nwhom among the criminals they would like to grant life.", "Having received\n\nthe reply that it was Bar-Rabban, the procurator said:\n\n\u2018Very well,\u2019 and told the secretary to put it into the record at once,\n\nclutched in his hand the clasp that the secretary had picked up from the\n\nsand, and said solemnly: \u2018It is time!\u2019\n\nHere all those present started down the wide marble stairway between\n\nwalls of roses that exuded a stupefying aroma, descending lower and lower\n\ntowards the palace wall, to the gates opening on to the big, smoothly paved\n\nsquare, at the end of which could be seen the columns and statues of the\n\nYershalaim stadium.", "As soon as the group entered the square from the garden and mounted the\n\nspacious stone platform that dominated the square, Pilate, looking around\n\nthrough narrowed eyelids, assessed the situation.", "The space he had just traversed, that is, the space from the palace wall to\n\nthe platform, was empty, but before him Pilate could no longer see the\n\nsquare - it had been swallowed up by the crowd, which would 38 have\n\npoured over the platform and the cleared space as well, had it not been kept\n\nat bay by a triple row of Sebastean soldiers to the left of Pilate and soldiers\n\nof the auxiliary Iturean cohort to his right.", "And so, Pilate mounted the platform, mechanically clutching the useless\n\nclasp in his fist and squinting his eyes.", "The procurator was squinting not\n\nbecause the sun burned his eyes - no!", "For some reason he did not want to\n\nsee the group of condemned men who, as he knew perfectly well, were now\n\nbeing brought on to the platform behind him.", "As soon as the white cloak with crimson lining appeared high up on the\n\nstone cliff over the verge of the human sea, the unseeing Pilate was struck\n\nin the ears by a wave of sound: \u2018Ha-a-a...\u2019 It started mutedly, arising\n\nsomewhere far away by the hippodrome, then became thunderous and,\n\nhaving held out for a few seconds, began to subside.", "\u2018They\u2019ve seen me,\u2019 the\n\nprocurator thought.", "The wave had not reached its lowest point before it\n\nstarted swelling again unexpectedly and, swaying, rose higher than the first,\n\nand as foam boils up on the billows of the sea, so a whistling boiled up on\n\nthis second wave and, separate, distinguishable from the thunder, the wails\n\nof women.", "\u2018They\u2019ve been led on to the platform,\u2019 thought Pilate, \u2018and the\n\nwails mean that several women got crushed as the crowd surged forward.\u2019\n\nHe waited for some time, knowing that no power could silence the crowd\n\nbefore it exhaled all that was pent up in it and fell silent of itself.", "And when this moment came, the procurator threw up his right arm, and\n\nthe last noise was blown away from the crowd.", "Then Pilate drew into his breast as much of the hot air as he could and\n\nshouted, and his cracked voice carried over thousands of heads:\n\n\u2018In the name of the emperor Caesar!", "...\u2019\n\nHere his ears were struck several times by a clipped iron shout: the\n\ncohorts of soldiers raised high their spears and standards and shouted out\n\nterribly:\n\n\u2018Long live Caesar!\u2019\n\nPilate lifted his face and thrust it straight into the sun.", "Green fire flared\n\nup behind his eyelids, his brain took flame from it, and hoarse Aramaic\n\nwords went flying over the crowd:\n\n\u2018Four criminals, arrested in Yershalaim for murder, incitement to\n\nrebellion, and outrages against the laws and the faith, have been sentenced\n\nto a shameful execution \u2014 by hanging on posts!", "And this execution will\n\npresently be carried out on Bald Mountain!", "The names of the criminals are\n\nDysmas, Gestas, Bar-Rabban and Ha-Nozri.", "Here they stand before you!\u2019\n\nPilate pointed to his right, not seeing any criminals, but knowing they\n\nwere there, in place, where they ought to be.", "The crowd responded with a long rumble as if of surprise or relief.", "When\n\nit died down, Pilate continued:\n\n\u2018But only three of them will be executed, for, in accordance with law and\n\ncustom, in honour of the feast of Passover, to one of the condemned, as\n\nchosen by the Lesser Sanhedrin and confirmed by Roman authority, the\n\nmagnanimous emperor Caesar will return his contemptible life!\u2019\n\nPilate cried out the words and at the same time listened as the rumble was\n\nreplaced by a great silence.", "Not a sigh, not a rustle reached his ears now,\n\nand there was even a moment when it seemed to Pilate that everything\n\naround him had vanished altogether.", "The hated city died, and he alone is\n\nstanding there, scorched by the sheer rays, his face set against the sky.", "Pilate held the silence a little longer, and then began to cry out:\n\n\u2018The name of the one who will now be set free before you is ...\u2019\n\nHe made one more pause, holding back the name, making sure he had\n\nsaid all, because he knew that the dead city would resurrect once the name\n\nof the lucky man was spoken, and no further words would be heard.", "\u2018All?\u2019 Pilate whispered soundlessly to himself.", "\u2018All.", "The name!\u2019\n\nAnd, rolling the letter \u2018r\u2019 over the silent city, he cried:\n\n\u2018Bar-Rabban!\u2019\n\nHere it seemed to him that the sun, clanging, burst over him and flooded\n\nhis ears with fire.", "This fire raged with roars, shrieks, wails, guffaws and\n\nwhistles.", "Pilate turned and walked back across the platform to the stairs, looking at\n\nnothing except the multicoloured squares of the flooring under his feet, so\n\nas not to trip.", "He knew that behind his back the platform was being\n\nshowered with bronze coins, dates, that people in the howling mob were\n\nclimbing on shoulders, crushing each other, to see the miracle with their\n\nown eyes - how a man already in the grip of death escaped that grip!", "How\n\nthe legionaries take the ropes off him, involuntarily causing him burning\n\npain in his arms, dislocated during his interrogation; how he, wincing and\n\ngroaning, nevertheless smiles a senseless, crazed smile.", "He knew that at the same time the convoy was already leading the three\n\nmen with bound arms to the side stairs, so as to take them to the road going\n\nwest from the city, towards Bald Mountain.", "Only when he was off the\n\nplatform, to the rear of it, did Pilate open his eyes, knowing that he was\n\nnow safe \u2014 he could no longer see the condemned men.", "Mingled with the wails of the quieting crowd, yet distinguishable from\n\nthem, were the piercing cries of heralds repeating, some in Aramaic, others\n\nin Greek, all that the procurator had cried out from the platform.", "Besides\n\nthat, there came to his ears the tapping, clattering and approaching thud of\n\nhoofs, and a trumpet calling out something brief and merry.", "These sounds\n\nwere answered by the drilling whistles of boys on the roofs of houses along\n\nthe street that led from the bazaar to the hippodrome square, and by cries of\n\n\u2018Look out!\u2019\n\nA soldier, standing alone in the cleared space of the square with a\n\nstandard in his hand, waved it anxiously, and then the procurator, the legate\n\nof the legion, the secretary and the convoy stopped.", "A cavalry ala, at an ever-lengthening trot, flew out into the square, so as\n\nto cross it at one side, bypassing the mass of people, and ride down a lane\n\nunder a stone wall covered with creeping vines, taking the shortest route to\n\nBald Mountain.", "At a flying trot, small as a boy, dark as a mulatto, the commander of the\n\nala, a Syrian, coming abreast of Pilate, shouted something in a high voice\n\nand snatched his sword from its sheath.", "The angry, sweating black horse\n\nshied and reared.", "Thrusting his sword back into its sheath, the commander\n\nstruck the horse\u2019s neck with his crop, brought him down, and rode off into\n\nthe lane, breaking into a gallop.", "After him, three by three, horsemen flew in\n\na cloud of dust, the tips of their light bamboo lances bobbing, and faces\n\ndashed past the procurator - looking especially swarthy under their white\n\nturbans \u2014 with merrily bared, gleaming teeth.", "Raising dust to the sky, the ala burst into the lane, and the last to ride past\n\nPilate was a soldier with a trumpet slung on his back, blazing in the sun.", "Shielding himself from the dust with his hand and wrinkling his face\n\ndiscontentedly, Pilate started on in the direction of the gates to the palace\n\ngarden, and after him came the legate, the secretary, and the convoy.", "It was around ten o\u2018clock in the morning.", "CHAPTER 3\n\nThe Seventh Proof\n\n\u2018Yes, it was around ten o\u2019clock in the morning, my esteemed Ivan\n\nNikolaevich,\u2018 said the professor.", "1 The poet passed his hand over his face like a man just coming to his\n\nsenses, and saw that it was evening at the Patriarch\u2019s Ponds.", "The water in\n\nthe pond had turned black, and a light boat was now gliding on it, and one\n\ncould hear the splash of oars and the giggles of some citizeness in the little\n\nboat.", "The public appeared on the benches along the walks, but again on the\n\nother three sides of the square, and not on the side where our interlocutors\n\nwere.", "The sky over Moscow seemed to lose colour, and the full moon could be\n\nseen quite distinctly high above, not yet golden but white.", "It was much\n\neasier to breathe, and the voices under the lindens now sounded softer,\n\n\n\n\n\neveningish.", "\u2018How is it I didn\u2019t notice that he\u2019d managed to spin a whole story?", "...\u2019\n\nHomeless thought in amazement.", "\u2018It\u2019s already evening!", "... Or maybe he\n\nwasn\u2019t telling it, but I simply fell asleep and dreamed it all?\u2019\n\nBut it must be supposed that the professor did tell the story after all,\n\notherwise it would have to be assumed that Berlioz had had the same\n\ndream, because he said, studying the foreigner\u2019s face attentively:\n\n\u2018Your story is extremely interesting, Professor, though it does not\n\ncoincide at all with the Gospel stories.\u2019\n\n\u2018Good heavens,\u2019 the professor responded, smiling condescendingly, \u2018you\n\nof all people should know that precisely nothing of what is written in the\n\nGospels ever actually took place, and if we start referring to the Gospels as\n\na historical source...\u2019 he smiled once more, and Berlioz stopped short,\n\nbecause this was literally the same thing he had been saying to Homeless as\n\nthey walked down Bronnaya towards the Patriarch\u2019s Ponds.", "\u2018That\u2019s so,\u2019 Berlioz replied, \u2018but I\u2019m afraid no one can confirm that what\n\nyou\u2019ve just told us actually took place either.\u2019\n\n\u2018Oh, yes!", "That there is one who can!\u2019 the professor, beginning to speak in\n\nbroken language, said with great assurance, and with unexpected\n\nmysteriousness he motioned the two friends to move closer.", "They leaned towards him from both sides, and he said, but again without\n\nany accent, which with him, devil knows why, now appeared, now\n\ndisappeared:\n\n\u2018The thing is ...\u2019 here the professor looked around fearfully and spoke in\n\na whisper, \u2018that I was personally present at it all.", "I was on Pontius Pilate\u2019s\n\nbalcony, and in the garden when he talked with Kaifa, and on the platform,\n\nonly secretly, incognito, so to speak, and therefore I beg you - not a word to\n\nanyone, total secrecy, shh ...\u2019\n\nSilence fell, and Berlioz paled.", "\u2018You ... how long have you been in Moscow?\u2019 he asked in a quavering\n\nvoice.", "\u2018I just arrived in Moscow this very minute,\u2019 the professor said\n\nperplexedly, and only here did it occur to the friends to take a good look in\n\nhis eyes, at which they became convinced that his left eye, the green one,\n\nwas totally insane, while the right one was empty, black and dead.", "\u2018There\u2019s the whole explanation for you!\u2019 Berlioz thought in\n\nbewilderment.", "\u2018A mad German has turned up, or just went crazy at the\n\nPonds.", "What a story!\u2019\n\nYes, indeed, that explained the whole thing: the most strange breakfast\n\nwith the late philosopher Kant, the foolish talk about sunflower oil and\n\nAnnushka, the predictions about his head being cut off and all the rest \u2014\n\nthe professor was mad.", "Berlioz realized at once what had to be done.", "Leaning back on the bench,\n\nhe winked to Homeless behind the professor\u2019s back \u2014 meaning, don\u2019t\n\ncontradict him \u2014 but the perplexed poet did not understand these signals.", "\u2018Yes, yes, yes,\u2019 Berlioz said excitedly, \u2018incidentally it\u2019s all possible ...\n\neven very possible, Pontius Pilate, and the balcony, and so forth ... Did you\n\ncome alone or with your wife?\u2019\n\n\u2018Alone, alone, I\u2019m always alone,\u2019 the professor replied bitterly.", "\u2018And where are your things, Professor?\u2019 Berlioz asked insinuatingly.", "\u2018At\n\nthe Metropol?1 Where are you staying?\u2019\n\n\u2018I?", "... Nowhere,\u2019 the half-witted German answered, his green eye\n\nwandering in wild anguish over the Patriarch\u2019s Ponds.", "\u2018How\u2019s that?", "But ... where are you going to live?\u2019\n\n\u2018In your apartment,\u2019 the madman suddenly said brashly, and winked.", "\u2018I ... I\u2019m very glad ...\u2019 Berlioz began muttering, \u2018but, really, you won\u2019t be\n\ncomfortable at my place ... and they have wonderful rooms at the Metropol,\n\nit\u2019s a first-class hotel ...\u2019\n\n\u2018And there\u2019s no devil either?\u2019 the sick man suddenly inquired merrily of\n\nIvan Nikolaevich.", "\u2018No devil...\u2019\n\n\u2018Don\u2019t contradict him,\u2019 Berlioz whispered with his lips only, dropping\n\nbehind the professor\u2019s back and making faces.", "\u2018There isn\u2019t any devil!\u2019 Ivan Nikolaevich, at a loss from all this\n\nbalderdash, cried out not what he ought.", "\u2018What a punishment!", "Stop playing\n\nthe psycho!\u2019\n\nHere the insane man burst into such laughter that a sparrow flew out of\n\nthe linden over the seated men\u2019s heads.", "\u2018Well, now that is positively interesting!\u2019 the professor said, shaking with\n\nlaughter.", "\u2018What is it with you \u2014 no matter what one asks for, there isn\u2019t\n\nany!\u2019 He suddenly stopped laughing and, quite understandably for a\n\nmentally ill person, fell into the opposite extreme after laughing, became\n\nvexed and cried sternly: \u2018So you mean there just simply isn\u2019t any?\u2019\n\n\u2018Calm down, calm down, calm down, Professor,\u2019 Berlioz muttered, for\n\nfear of agitating the sick man.", "\u2018You sit here for a little minute with Comrade\n\nHomeless, and I\u2019ll just run to the comer to make a phone call, and then\n\nwe\u2019ll take you wherever you like.", "You don\u2019t know the city ...\u2019\n\nBerlioz\u2019s plan must be acknowledged as correct: he had to run to the\n\nnearest public telephone and inform the foreigners\u2019 bureau, thus and so,\n\nthere\u2019s some consultant from abroad sitting at the Patriarch\u2019s Ponds in an\n\nobviously abnormal state.", "So it was necessary to take measures, lest some\n\nunpleasant nonsense result.", "\u2018To make a call?", "Well, then make your call,\u2019 the sick man agreed sadly,\n\nand suddenly begged passionately: \u2018But I implore you, before you go, at\n\nleast believe that the devil exists!", "I no longer ask you for anything more.", "Mind you, there exists a seventh proof of it, the surest of all!", "And it is going\n\nto be presented to you right now!\u2019\n\n\u2018Very good, very good,\u2019 Berlioz said with false tenderness and, winking\n\nto the upset poet, who did not relish at all the idea of guarding the mad\n\nGerman, set out for the exit from the Ponds at the comer of Bronnaya and\n\nYermolaevsky Lane.", "And the professor seemed to recover his health and brighten up at once.", "\u2018Mikhail Alexandrovich!\u2019 he shouted after Berlioz.", "The latter gave a start, looked back, but reassured himself with the\n\nthought that the professor had also learned his name and patronymic from\n\nsome newspaper.", "Then the professor called out, cupping his hands like a megaphone:\n\n\u2018Would you like me to have a telegram sent at once to your uncle in\n\nKiev?\u2019\n\nAnd again Berlioz winced.", "How does the madman know about the\n\nexistence of a Kievan uncle?", "That has certainly never been mentioned in\n\nany newspapers.", "Oh-oh, maybe Homeless is right after all?", "And suppose his\n\npapers are phoney?", "Ah, what a strange specimen ...", "Call, call!", "Call at once!", "They\u2019ll quickly explain him!", "And, no longer listening to anything, Berlioz ran on.", "Here, just at the exit to Bronnaya, there rose from a bench to meet the\n\neditor exactly the same citizen who in the sunlight earlier had formed\n\nhimself out of the thick swelter.", "Only now he was no longer made of air, but\n\nordinary, fleshly, and Berlioz clearly distinguished in the beginning twilight\n\nthat he had a little moustache like chicken feathers, tiny eyes, ironic and\n\nhalf drunk, and checkered trousers pulled up so high that his dirty white\n\nsocks showed.", "Mikhail Alexandrovich drew back, but reassured himself by reflecting\n\nthat it was a stupid coincidence and that generally there was no time to\n\nthink about it now.", "\u2018Looking for the turnstile, citizen?\u2019 the checkered type inquired in a\n\ncracked tenor.", "\u2018This way, please!", "Straight on and you\u2019ll get where you\u2019re\n\ngoing.", "How about a little pint pot for my information ... to set up an ex-\n\nchoirmaster!...\u2019 Mugging, the specimen swept his jockey\u2019s cap from his\n\nhead.", "Berlioz, not stopping to listen to the cadging and clowning choirmaster,\n\nran up to the turnstile and took hold of it with his hand.", "He turned it and\n\nwas just about to step across the rails when red and white light splashed in\n\nhis face.", "A sign lit up in a glass box: \u2018Caution Tram-Car!\u2019\n\nAnd right then this tram-car came racing along, turning down the newly\n\nlaid line from Yermolaevsky to Bronnaya.", "Having turned, and coming to the\n\nstraight stretch, it suddenly lit up inside with electricity, whined, and put on\n\nspeed.", "The prudent Berlioz, though he was standing in a safe place, decided to\n\nretreat behind the stile, moved his hand on the crossbar, and stepped back.", "And right then his hand slipped and slid, one foot, unimpeded, as if on ice,\n\nwent down the cobbled slope leading to the rails, the other was thrust into\n\nthe air, and Berlioz was thrown on to the rails.", "Trying to get hold of something, Berlioz fell backwards, the back of his\n\nhead lightly striking the cobbles, and had time to see high up \u2014 but\n\nwhether to right or left he no longer knew \u2014 the gold-tinged moon.", "He\n\nmanaged to turn on his side, at the same moment drawing his legs to his\n\nstomach in a frenzied movement, and, while turning, to make out the face,\n\ncompletely white with horror, and the crimson armband of the woman\n\ndriver bearing down on him with irresistible force.", "Berlioz did not cry out,\n\nbut around him the whole street screamed with desperate female voices.", "The woman driver tore at the electric brake, the car dug its nose into the\n\nground, then instantly jumped up, and glass flew from the windows with a\n\ncrash and a jingle.", "Here someone in Berlioz\u2019s brain cried desperately: \u2018Can\n\nit be?", "...\u2019 Once more, and for the last time, the moon flashed, but now\n\nbreaking to pieces, and then it became dark.", "The tram-car went over Berlioz, and a round dark object was thrown up\n\nthe cobbled slope below the fence of the Patriarch\u2019s walk.", "Having rolled\n\nback down this slope, it went bouncing along the cobblestones of the street.", "It was the severed head of Berlioz.", "CHAPTER 4\n\nThe Chase\n\nThe hysterical women\u2019s cries died down, the police whistles stopped\n\ndrilling, two ambulances drove off - one with the headless body and severed\n\nhead, to the morgue, the other with the beautiful driver, wounded by broken\n\nglass; street sweepers in white aprons removed the broken glass and poured\n\nsand on the pools of blood, but Ivan Nikolaevich just stayed on the bench as\n\nhe had dropped on to it before reaching the turnstile.", "He tried several times\n\nto get up, but his legs would not obey him \u2014 something akin to paralysis\n\nhad occurred with Homeless.", "The poet had rushed to the turnstile as soon as he heard the first scream,\n\nand had seen the head go bouncing along the pavement.", "With that he so lost\n\nhis senses that, having dropped on to the bench, he bit his hand until it bled.", "Of course, he forgot about the mad German and tried to figure out one thing\n\nonly: how it could be that he had just been talking with Berlioz, and a\n\nmoment later - the head ...\n\nAgitated people went running down the walk past the poet, exclaiming\n\nsomething, but Ivan Nikolaevich was insensible to their words.", "However,\n\ntwo women unexpectedly ran into each other near him, and one of them,\n\nsharp-nosed and bare-headed, shouted the following to the other, right next\n\nto the poet\u2019s ear:\n\n\u2018... Annushka, our Annushka!", "From Sadovaya!", "It\u2019s her work ... She\n\nbought sunflower oil at the grocery, and went and broke the whole litre-\n\nbottle on the turnstile!", "Messed her skirt all up, and swore and swore!", "... And\n\nhe, poor man, must have slipped and - right on to the rails ...\u2019\n\nOf all that the woman shouted, one word lodged itself in Ivan\n\nNikolaevich\u2019s upset brain: \u2018Annushka\u2019...\n\n\u2018Annushka ... Annushka?\u2019 the poet muttered, looking around anxiously.", "\u2018Wait a minute, wait a minute ...\u2019\n\nThe word \u2018Annushka\u2019 got strung together with the words \u2019sunflower oil\u2018,\n\nand then for some reason with \u2019Pontius Pilate\u2018.", "The poet dismissed Pilate\n\nand began linking up the chain that started from the word \u2019Annushka\u2018.", "And\n\nthis chain got very quickly linked up and led at once to the mad professor.", "\u2018Excuse me!", "But he did say the meeting wouldn\u2019t take place because\n\nAnnushka had spilled the oil.", "And, if you please, it won\u2019t take place!", "What\u2019s more, he said straight out that Berlioz\u2019s head would be cut off by a\n\nwoman?!", "Yes, yes, yes!", "And the driver was a woman!", "What is all this, eh?", "!\u2019\n\nThere was not a grain of doubt left that the mysterious consultant had\n\nknown beforehand the exact picture of the terrible death of Berlioz.", "Here\n\ntwo thoughts pierced the poet\u2019s brain.", "The first: \u2018He\u2019s not mad in the least,\n\nthat\u2019s all nonsense!\u2019 And the second: \u2018Then didn\u2019t he set it all up himself?\u2019\n\n\u2018But in what manner, may we ask?!", "Ah, no, this we\u2019re going to find out!\u2019\n\nMaking a great effort, Ivan Nikolaevich got up from the bench and\n\nrushed back to where he had been talking with the professor.", "And,\n\nfortunately, it turned out that the man had not left yet.", "The street lights were already lit on Bronnaya, and over the Ponds the\n\ngolden moon shone, and in the ever-deceptive light of the moon it seemed\n\nto Ivan Nikolaevich that he stood holding a sword, not a walking stick,\n\nunder his arm.", "The ex-choirmaster was sitting in the very place where Ivan Nikolaevich\n\nhad sat just recently.", "Now the busybody had perched on his nose an\n\nobviously unnecessary pince-nez, in which one lens was missing altogether\n\nand the other was cracked.", "This made the checkered citizen even more\n\nrepulsive than he had been when he showed Berlioz the way to the rails.", "With a chill in his heart, Ivan approached the professor and, glancing into\n\nhis face, became convinced that there were not and never had been any\n\nsigns of madness in that face.", "\u2018Confess, who are you?\u2019 Ivan asked in a hollow voice.", "The foreigner scowled, looked at the poet as if he were seeing him for the\n\nfirst time, and answered inimically:\n\n\u2018No understand ... no speak Russian ...\u2019\n\n\u2018The gent don\u2019t understand,\u2019 the choirmaster mixed in from the bench,\n\nthough no one had asked him to explain the foreigner\u2019s words.", "\u2018Don\u2019t pretend!\u2019 Ivan said threateningly, and felt cold in the pit of his\n\nstomach.", "\u2018You spoke excellent Russian just now.", "You\u2019re not a German and\n\nyou\u2019re not a professor!", "You\u2019re a murderer and a spy!", "...", "Your papers!\u2019 Ivan\n\ncried fiercely.", "The mysterious professor squeamishly twisted his mouth, which was\n\ntwisted to begin with, then shrugged his shoulders.", "\u2018Citizen!\u2019 the loathsome choirmaster butted in again.", "\u2018What\u2019re you doing\n\nbothering a foreign tourist?", "For that you\u2019ll incur severe punishment!\u2019\n\nAnd the suspicious professor made an arrogant face, turned, and walked\n\naway from Ivan.", "Ivan felt himself at a loss.", "Breathless, he addressed the\n\nchoirmaster.", "\u2018Hey, citizen, help me to detain the criminal!", "It\u2019s your duty!\u2019\n\nThe choirmaster became extraordinarily animated, jumped up and\n\nhollered:\n\n\u2018What criminal?", "Where is he?", "A foreign criminal?\u2019 The choirmaster\u2019s\n\neyes sparkled gleefully.", "That one?", "If he\u2019s a criminal, the first thing to do is\n\nshout \u201cHelp!\u201d Or else he\u2019ll get away.", "Come on, together now, one, two!\u2018 -\n\nand here the choirmaster opened his maw.", "Totally at a loss, Ivan obeyed the trickster and shouted \u2018Help!\u2019 but the\n\nchoirmaster bluffed him and did not shout anything.", "Ivan\u2019s solitary, hoarse cry did not produce any good results.", "Two girls\n\nshied away from him, and he heard the word \u2018drunk\u2019.", "\u2018Ah, so you\u2019re in with him!\u2019 Ivan cried out, waxing wroth.", "\u2018What are you\n\ndoing, jeering at me?", "Out of my way!\u2019\n\nIvan dashed to the right, and so did the choirmaster; Ivan dashed to the\n\nleft, and the scoundrel did the same.", "\u2018Getting under my feet on purpose?\u2019 Ivan cried, turning ferocious.", "\u2018I\u2019ll\n\nhand you over to the police!\u2019\n\nIvan attempted to grab the blackguard by the sleeve, but missed and\n\ncaught precisely nothing: it was as if the choirmaster fell through the earth.", "Ivan gasped, looked into the distance, and saw the hateful stranger.", "He\n\nwas already at the exit to Patriarch\u2019s Lane; moreover, he was not alone.", "The\n\nmore than dubious choirmaster had managed to join him.", "But that was still\n\nnot all: the third in this company proved to be a tom-cat, who appeared out\n\nof nowhere, huge as a hog, black as soot or as a rook, and with a desperate\n\ncavalryman\u2019s whiskers.", "The trio set off down Patriarch\u2019s Lane, the cat\n\nwalking on his hind legs.", "Ivan sped after the villains and became convinced at once that it would\n\nbe very difficult to catch up with them.", "The trio shot down the lane in an instant and came out on Spiridonovka.", "No matter how Ivan quickened his pace, the distance between him and his\n\nquarry never diminished.", "And before the poet knew it, he emerged, after the\n\nquiet of Spiridonovka, by the Nikitsky Gate, where his situation worsened.", "The place was swarming with people.", "Besides, the gang of villains decided\n\nto apply the favourite trick of bandits here: a scattered getaway.", "The choirmaster, with great dexterity, bored his way on to a bus speeding\n\ntowards the Arbat Square and slipped away.", "Having lost one of his quarry,\n\nIvan focused his attention on the cat and saw this strange cat go up to the\n\nfootboard of an \u2018A\u2019 tram waiting at a stop, brazenly elbow aside a woman,\n\nwho screamed, grab hold of the handrail, and even make an attempt to\n\nshove a ten-kopeck piece into the conductress\u2019s hand through the window,\n\nopen on account of the stuffiness.", "Ivan was so struck by the cat\u2019s behaviour that he froze motionless by the\n\ngrocery store on the comer, and here he was struck for a second time, but\n\nmuch more strongly, by the conductress\u2019s behaviour.", "As soon as she saw the\n\ncat getting into the tram-car, she shouted with a malice that even made her\n\nshake:\n\n\u2018No cats allowed!", "Nobody with cats allowed!", "Scat!", "Get off, or I\u2019ll call the\n\npolice!\u2019\n\nNeither the conductress nor the passengers were struck by the essence of\n\nthe matter: not just that a cat was boarding a tram-car, which would have\n\nbeen good enough, but that he was going to pay!", "The cat turned out to be not only a solvent but also a disciplined animal.", "At the very first shout from the conductress, he halted his advance, got off\n\nthe footboard, and sat down at the stop, rubbing his whiskers with the ten-\n\nkopeck piece.", "But as soon as the conductress yanked the cord and the tram-\n\ncar started moving off, the cat acted like anyone who has been expelled\n\nfrom a tram-car but still needs a ride.", "Letting all three cars go by, the cat\n\njumped on to the rear coupling-pin of the last one, wrapped its paws around\n\nsome hose sticking out of the side, and rode off, thus saving himself ten\n\nkopecks.", "Occupied with the obnoxious cat, Ivan almost lost the main one of the\n\nthree \u2014 the professor.", "But, fortunately, the man had not managed to slip\n\naway.", "Ivan saw the grey beret in the throng at the head of Bolshaya\n\nNikitskaya, now Herzen, Street.", "In the twinkling of an eye, Ivan arrived\n\nthere himself.", "However, he had no luck.", "The poet would quicken his pace,\n\nbreak into a trot, shove passers-by, yet not get an inch closer to the\n\nprofessor.", "Upset as he was, Ivan was still struck by the supernatural speed of the\n\nchase.", "Twenty seconds had not gone by when, after the Nikitsky Gate, Ivan\n\nNikolaevich was already dazzled by the lights of the Arbat Square.", "Another\n\nfew seconds, and here was some dark lane with slanting sidewalks, where\n\nIvan Nikolaevich took a tumble and hurt his knee.", "Again a lit-up\n\nthoroughfare \u2014 Kropotkin Street \u2014 then a lane, then Ostozhenka, then\n\nanother lane, dismal, vile and sparsely lit.", "And it was here that Ivan\n\nNikolaevich definitively lost him whom he needed so much.", "The professor\n\ndisappeared.", "Ivan Nikolaevich was perplexed, but not for long, because he suddenly\n\nrealized that the professor must unfailingly be found in house no.", "13, and\n\nmost assuredly in apartment 47.", "Bursting into the entrance, Ivan Nikolaevich flew up to the second floor,\n\nimmediately found the apartment, and rang impatiently.", "He did not have to\n\nwait long.", "Some little girl of about five opened the door for Ivan and,\n\nwithout asking him anything, immediately went away somewhere.", "In the huge, extremely neglected front hall, weakly lit by a tiny carbon\n\narc lamp under the high ceiling, black with grime, a bicycle without tyres\n\nhung on the wall, a huge iron-bound trunk stood, and on a shelf over the\n\ncoat rack a winter hat lay, its long ear-flaps hanging down.", "Behind one of\n\nthe doors, a resonant male voice was angrily shouting something in verse\n\nfrom a radio set.", "Ivan Nikolaevich was not the least at a loss in the unfamiliar\n\nsurroundings and rushed straight into the corridor, reasoning thus: \u2018Of\n\ncourse, he\u2019s hiding in the bathroom.\u2019 The corridor was dark.", "Having\n\nbumped into the wall a few times, Ivan saw a faint streak of light under a\n\ndoor, felt for the handle, and pulled it gently.", "The hook popped out, and\n\nIvan found himself precisely in the bathroom and thought how lucky he\n\nwas.", "However, his luck was not all it might have been!", "Ivan met with a wave\n\nof humid heat and, by the light of the coals smouldering in the boiler, made\n\nout big basins hanging on the walls, and a bath tub, all black frightful\n\nblotches where the enamel had chipped off.", "And there, in this bath tub,\n\nstood a naked citizeness, all soapy and with a scrubber in her hand.", "She\n\nsquinted near-sightedly at the bursting-in Ivan and, obviously mistaking\n\nhim in the infernal light, said softly and gaily:\n\n\u2018Kiriushka!", "Stop this tomfoolery!", "Have you lost your mind?", "... Fyodor\n\nIvanych will be back any minute.", "Get out right now!\u2019 and she waved at Ivan\n\nwith the scrubber.", "The misunderstanding was evident, and Ivan Nikolaevich was, of course,\n\nto blame for it.", "But he did not want to admit it and, exclaiming\n\nreproachfully: \u2018Ah, wanton creature!", "...\u2019, at once found himself for some\n\nreason in the kitchen.", "No one was there, and on the oven in the semi-\n\ndarkness silently stood about a dozen extinguished primuses.1 A single\n\nmoonbeam, having seeped through the dusty, perennially unwashed\n\nwindow, shone sparsely into the comer where, in dust and cobwebs, a\n\nforgotten icon hung, with the ends of two wedding candles2 peeking out\n\nfrom behind its casing.", "Under the big icon, pinned to it, hung a little one\n\nmade of paper.", "No one knows what thought took hold of Ivan here, but before running\n\nout the back door, he appropriated one of these candles, as well as the paper\n\nicon.", "With these objects, he left the unknown apartment, muttering\n\nsomething, embarrassed at the thought of what he had just experienced in\n\nthe bathroom, involuntarily trying to guess who this impudent Kiriushka\n\nmight be and whether the disgusting hat with ear-flaps belonged to him.", "In the desolate, joyless lane the poet looked around, searching for the\n\nfugitive, but he was nowhere to be seen.", "Then Ivan said firmly to himself:\n\n\u2018Why, of course, he\u2019s at the Moscow River!", "Onward!\u2019\n\nSomeone ought, perhaps, to have asked Ivan Nikolaevich why he\n\nsupposed that the professor was precisely at the Moscow River and not in\n\nsome other place.", "But the trouble was that there was no one to ask him.", "The\n\nloathsome lane was completely empty.", "In the very shortest time, Ivan Nikolaevich could be seen on the granite\n\nsteps of the Moscow River amphitheatre.3\n\nHaving taken off his clothes, Ivan entrusted them to a pleasant, bearded\n\nfellow who was smoking a hand-rolled cigarette, sitting beside a torn white\n\nTolstoy blouse and a pair of unlaced, worn boots.", "After waving his arms to\n\ncool off, Ivan dived swallow-fashion into the water.", "It took his breath away,\n\nso cold the water was, and the thought even flashed in him that he might not\n\nmanage to come up to the surface.", "However, he did manage to come up,\n\nand, puffing and snorting, his eyes rounded in terror, Ivan Nikolaevich\n\nbegan swimming through the black, oil-smelling water among the broken\n\nzigzags of street lights on the bank.", "When the wet Ivan came dancing back up the steps to the place where the\n\nbearded fellow was guarding his clothes, it became clear that not only the\n\nlatter, but also the former \u2014 that is, the bearded fellow himself \u2014 had been\n\nstolen.", "In the exact spot where the pile of clothes had been, a pair of striped\n\ndrawers, the torn Tolstoy blouse, the candle, the icon and a box of matches\n\nhad been left.", "After threatening someone in the distance with his fist in\n\npowerless anger, Ivan put on what was left for him.", "Here two considerations began to trouble him: first, that his Massolit\n\nidentification card, which he never parted with, was gone, and, second,\n\nwhether he could manage to get through Moscow unhindered looking the\n\nway he did now?", "In striped drawers, after all ...", "True, it was nobody\u2019s\n\nbusiness, but still there might be some hitch or delay.", "Ivan tore off the buttons where the drawers fastened at the ankle, figuring\n\nthat this way they might pass for summer trousers, gathered up the icon, the\n\ncandle and the matches, and started off, saying to himself:\n\n\u2018To Griboedov\u2019s!", "Beyond all doubt, he\u2019s there.\u2018\n\nThe city was already living its evening life.", "Trucks flew through the dust,\n\nchains clanking, and on their platforms men lay sprawled belly up on sacks.", "All windows were open.", "In each of these windows a light burned under an\n\norange lampshade, and from every window, every door, every gateway,\n\nroof, and attic, basement and courtyard blared the hoarse roar of the\n\npolonaise from the opera Evgeny Onegin.4\n\nIvan Nikolaevich\u2019s apprehensions proved fully justified: passers-by did\n\npay attention to him and turned their heads.", "As a result, he took the decision\n\nto leave the main streets and make his way through back lanes, where\n\npeople are not so importunate, where there were fewer chances of them\n\npicking on a barefoot man, pestering him with questions about his drawers,\n\nwhich stubbornly refused to look like trousers.", "This Ivan did, and, penetrating the mysterious network of lanes around\n\nthe Arbat, he began making his way along the walls, casting fearful\n\nsidelong glances, turning around every moment, hiding in gateways from\n\ntime to time, avoiding intersections with traffic lights and the grand\n\nentrances of embassy mansions.", "And all along his difficult way, he was for some reason inexpressibly\n\ntormented by the ubiquitous orchestra that accompanied the heavy basso\n\nsinging about his love for Tatiana.", "CHAPTER 5\n\nThere were Doings at Griboedov\u2019s\n\nThe old, two-storeyed, cream-coloured house stood on the ring boulevard,\n\nin the depths of a seedy garden, separated from the sidewalk by a fancy\n\ncast-iron fence.", "The small terrace in front of the house was paved with\n\nasphalt, and in wintertime was dominated by a snow pile with a shovel\n\nstuck in it, but in summertime turned into the most magnificent section of\n\nthe summer restaurant under a canvas tent.", "The house was called \u2018The House of Griboedov\u2019 on the grounds that it\n\nwas alleged to have once belonged to an aunt of the writer Alexander\n\nSergeevich Griboedov.1 Now, whether it did or did not belong to her, we do\n\nnot exactly know.", "On recollection, it even seems that Griboedov never had\n\nany such house-owning aunt ...", "Nevertheless, that was what the house was\n\ncalled.", "Moreover, one Moscow liar had it that there, on the second floor, in\n\na round hall with columns, the famous writer had supposedly read passages\n\nfrom Woe From Wit to this very aunt while she reclined on a sofa.", "However,\n\ndevil knows, maybe he did, it\u2019s of no importance.", "What is important is that at the present time this house was owned by that\n\nsame Massolit which had been headed by the unfortunate Mikhail\n\nAlexandrovich Berlioz before his appearance at the Patriarch\u2019s Ponds.", "In the casual manner of Massolit members, no one called the house \u2018The\n\nHouse of Griboedov\u2019, everyone simply said \u2018Griboedov\u2019s\u2018: \u2019I spent two\n\nhours yesterday knocking about Griboedov\u2019s.\u2018 \u2019Well, and so?\u2018 \u2019Got myself\n\na month in Yalta.\u2018 \u2019Bravo!\u2018 Or: \u2019Go to Berlioz, he receives today from four\n\nto five at Griboedov\u2019s

the second floor.", "On the door to the very first room of this upper floor one could see a big\n\nsign: \u2018Fishing and Vacation Section\u2019, along with the picture of a carp caught\n\non a

not heard right.", "Utterly bewildered, he trotted back to the bedroom\n\nand froze on the threshold.", "His hair stood on end and small beads of sweat\n\nbroke out on his brow.", "The visitor was no longer alone in the bedroom, but had company: in the\n\nsecond armchair sat the same type he had imagined in the front hall.", "Now\n\nhe was clearly visible: the feathery moustache, one lens of the pince-nez\n\ngleaming, the other not there.", "But worse things were to be found in the\n\nbedroom: on the jeweller\u2019s wife\u2019s ottoman, in a casual pose, sprawled a\n\nthird party - namely, a

thereby\n\nexpress his protest at being detained for nothing.", "But today\u2019s Ivan already\n\ndiffered significantly from the Ivan of yesterday, and this first way appeared\n\ndubious to him: for all he knew, the thought might get rooted in them that\n\nhe was a violent madman.", "Therefore Ivan rejected the first way.", "There was\n\na second: immediately to begin his account of the consultant and Pontius\n\nPilate.", "However, yesterday\u2019s experience showed that this story either was\n\nnot believed or was taken somehow perversely.", "Therefore Ivan renounced\n\nthis second way as well, deciding to choose the third way \u2014 withdrawal\n\ninto proud silence.", "He did not succeed in realizing it fully, and had willy-nilly to answer,\n\nthough charily and glumly, a whole series of questions.", "Thus they got out of\n\nIvan decidedly everything about his past life, down to when and how he had\n\nfallen ill with scarlet fever fifteen years ago.", "A whole page having been\n\ncovered with writing about Ivan, it was turned over, and the woman in\n\nwhite went on to questions about Ivan\u2019s relatives.", "Some sort of humdrum\n\nstarted: who died when and why, and

and\n\nthey pricked Ivan in the back with something, but not painfully, drew some\n\nsigns on the skin of his chest with the handle of a little hammer, tapped his\n\nknees with the hammer, which made Ivan\u2019s legs jump, pricked his finger\n\nand took his blood, pricked him inside his bent elbow, put some rubber\n\nbracelets on his arms ...\n\nIvan just smiled bitterly to himself and reflected on how stupidly and\n\nstrangely it had all happened.", "Just think!", "He had wanted to warn them all of\n\nthe danger threatening from the unknown consultant, had intended to catch\n\nhim, and all he had achieved was to wind up in some mysterious room,\n\ntelling all sorts of hogwash about Uncle Fyodor, who had done some hard\n\ndrinking in Vologda.", "Insufferably stupid!", "Finally Ivan was released.", "He was escorted back to his room, where he\n\nwas given a cup of coffee, two soft-boiled eggs and white bread with butter.", "Having eaten and drunk all that was offered him, Ivan decided to wait for\n\nwhoever was chief of this institution, and from this chief to obtain both\n\nattention for himself and justice.", "And he did come, and very soon after Ivan\u2019s breakfast.", "Unexpectedly, the\n\ndoor of Ivan\u2019s room opened, and in came a lot of people in white coats.", "At\n\ntheir head walked a man of about forty-five, as carefully shaven as an actor,\n\nwith pleasant but quite piercing eyes and courteous manners.", "The whole\n\nretinue showed him tokens of attention and respect, and his entrance\n\ntherefore came out very solemn.", "\u2018Like Pontius Pilate!\u2019 thought Ivan.", "Yes, this was unquestionably the chief.", "He sat down on a stool, while\n\neveryone else remained standing.", "\u2018Doctor Stravinsky,\u2019 the seated man introduced himself to Ivan and gave\n\nhim a friendly look.", "\u2018Here, Alexander Nikolaevich,\u2019 someone with a trim beard said in a low\n\nvoice, and handed the chief Ivan\u2019s chart, all covered with writing.", "\u2018They\u2019ve sewn up a whole case!\u2019 Ivan thought.", "And the chief ran through\n\nthe chart with a practised eye, muttered \u2018Mm-hm, mm-hm ...\u2019, and\n\nexchanged a few phrases with those around him in a little-known language.", "\u2018And he speaks Latin like Pilate,\u2019 Ivan thought sadly.", "Here one word made\n\nhim jump; it was the word \u2018schizophrenia\u2019 \u2014 alas, already uttered\n\nyesterday by the cursed foreigner at the Patriarch\u2019s Ponds, and now\n\nrepeated today by Professor Stravinsky.", "\u2019And he knew that, too!\u2018 Ivan\n\nthought anxiously.", "The chief apparently made it a rule to agree with and rejoice over\n\neverything said to him by those around him, and to express this with the\n\nwords \u2018Very nice, very nice ...\u2019\n\n\u2018Very nice!\u2019 said Stravinsky, handing the chart back to someone, and he\n\naddressed Ivan:\n\n\u2018You are a poet?\u2019\n\n\u2018A poet,\u2019 Ivan replied glumly, and for the first time suddenly felt some\n\ninexplicable loathing for poetry, and his own verses, coming to mind at\n\nonce, seemed to him for some reason distasteful.", "Wrinkling his face, he asked Stravinsky in turn:\n\n\u2018You are a professor?\u2019\n\nTo this, Stravinsky, with obliging courtesy, inclined his head.", "\u2018And you\u2019re the chief here?\u2019 Ivan continued.", "Stravinsky nodded to this as well.", "\u2018I must speak with you,\u2019 Ivan Nikolaevich said meaningly.", "That is what I\u2019m here for,\u2018 returned Stravinsky.", "The thing is,\u2018 Ivan began, feeling his hour had come, \u2019that I\u2019ve been got\n\nup as a madman, and nobody wants to listen to me!", "...\u2018\n\n\u2018Oh, no, we shall hear you out with great attention,\u2019 Stravinsky said\n\nseriously and soothingly, \u2018and by no means allow you to be got up as a\n\nmadman.\u2019\n\n\u2018Listen, then: yesterday evening I met a mysterious person at the\n\nPatriarch\u2019s Ponds, maybe a foreigner, maybe not, who knew beforehand\n\nabout Berlioz\u2019s death and has seen Pontius Pilate in person.\u2019\n\nThe retinue listened to the poet silently and without stirring.", "\u2018Pilate?", "The Pilate who lived in the time of Jesus Christ?\u2019 Stravinsky\n\nasked, narrowing his eyes at Ivan.", "The same.\u2018\n\n\u2018Aha,\u2019 said Stravinsky, \u2018and this Berlioz died under a tram-car?\u2019\n\n\u2018Precisely, he\u2019s the one who in my presence was killed by a tram-car\n\nyesterday at the Ponds, and this same mysterious citizen ...\u2019\n\nThe acquaintance of Pontius Pilate?\u2018 asked Stravinsky, apparently\n\ndistinguished by great mental alacrity.", "\u2018Precisely him,\u2019 Ivan confirmed, studying Stravinsky.", "\u2018Well, so he said\n\nbeforehand that Annushka had spilled the sunflower oil ... And he slipped\n\nright on that place!", "How do you like that?\u2019 Ivan inquired significantly,\n\nhoping to produce a great effect with his words.", "But the effect did not ensue, and Stravinsky quite simply asked the\n\nfollowing question:\n\n\u2018And who is this Annushka?\u2019\n\nThis question upset Ivan a little; his face twitched.", "\u2018Annushka is of absolutely no importance here,\u2019 he said nervously.", "\u2018Devil knows who she is.", "Just some fool from Sadovaya.", "What\u2019s important\n\nis that he knew beforehand, you see, beforehand, about the sunflower oil!", "Do you understand me?\u2019\n\n\u2018Perfectly,\u2019 Stravinsky replied seriously and, touching the poet\u2019s knee,\n\nadded: \u2018Don\u2019t get excited, just continue.\u2019\n\n\u2018To continue,\u2019 said Ivan, trying to fall in with Stravinsky\u2019s tone, and\n\nknowing already from bitter experience that only calm would help him, \u2018so,\n\nthen, this horrible type (and he\u2019s lying that he\u2019s a consultant) has some\n\nextraordinary power!", "... For instance, you chase after him and it\u2019s\n\nimpossible to catch up with him ... And there\u2019s also a little pair with him \u2014\n\ngood ones, too, but in their own way: some long one in broken glasses and,\n\nbesides him, a cat of incredible size who rides the tram all by himself.", "And\n\nbesides,\u2019 interrupted by no one, Ivan went on talking with ever increasing\n\nardour and conviction, \u2018he was personally on Pontius Pilate\u2019s balcony,\n\nthere\u2019s no doubt of it.", "So what is all this, eh?", "He must be arrested\n\nimmediately, otherwise he\u2019ll do untold harm.\u2019\n\n\u2018So you\u2019re trying to get him arrested?", "Have I understood you correctly?\u2019\n\nasked Stravinsky.", "\u2018He\u2019s intelligent,\u2019 thought Ivan.", "\u2018You\u2019ve got to admit, even among\n\nintellectuals you come across some of rare intelligence, there\u2019s no denying\n\nit,\u2019 and he replied:\n\n\u2018Quite correctly!", "And how could I not be trying, just consider for\n\nyourself!", "And meanwhile I\u2019ve been forcibly detained here, they poke lamps\n\ninto my eyes, give me baths, question me for some reason about my Uncle\n\nFedya!", "... And he departed this world long ago!", "I demand to be released\n\nimmediately!\u2019\n\n\u2018Well, there, very nice, very nice!\u2019 Stravinsky responded.", "\u2018Now\n\neverything\u2019s clear.",

tell.", "So, then, are you normal?\u2019\n\nHere complete silence fell, and the fat woman who had taken care of Ivan\n\nin the morning looked at the professor with awe.", "Ivan thought once again:\n\n\u2018Positively intelligent!\u2019\n\nThe professor\u2019s offer pleased him very much, yet before replying he\n\nthought very, very hard, wrinkling his forehead, and at last said firmly:\n\n\u2018I am normal.\u2019\n\n\u2018Well, how very nice,\u2019 Stravinsky exclaimed with relief, \u2018and if so, let\u2019s\n\nreason logically.", "Let\u2019s take your day yesterday.\u2019 Here he turned and Ivan\u2019s\n\nchart was immediately handed to him.", "\u2018In search of an unknown man who\n\nrecommended himself as an acquaintance of Pontius Pilate, you performed\n\nthe following actions yesterday.\u2019 Here Stravinsky began holding up his long\n\nfingers, glancing now at the chart, now at Ivan.", "\u2018You hung a little icon on\n\nyour chest.", "Did you?\u2019\n\n\u2018I did,\u2019 Ivan agreed sullenly.", "\u2018You fell off a fence and hurt your face.", "Right?", "Showed up in a restaurant\n\ncarrying a burning candle in your hand, in nothing but your underwear, and\n\nin the restaurant you beat somebody.", "You were brought here-tied up.", "Having come here, you called the police and asked them to send out\n\nmachine-guns.", "Then you attempted to throw yourself out the window.", "Right?", "The question is: can one, by acting in such fashion, catch or arrest\n\nanyone?", "And if you\u2019re a normal man, you yourself will answer: by no\n\nmeans.", "You wish to leave here?", "Very well, sir.", "But allow me to ask, where\n\nare you going to go?\u2019\n\nTo the police, of course,\u2018 Ivan replied, no longer so firmly, and

have no time to stop anywhere!", "While I\u2019m stopping at places, he\u2019ll slip\n\naway!\u2019\n\n\u2018So.", "And what will you tell the police to start with?\u2019\n\n\u2018About Pontius Pilate,\u2019 Ivan Nikolaevich replied, and his eyes clouded\n\nwith a gloomy mist.", "\u2018Well, how very nice!\u2019 the won-over Stravinsky exclaimed and, turning\n\nto the one with the little beard, ordered: \u2018Fyodor Vassilyevich, please check\n\nCitizen Homeless out for town.", "But don\u2019t put anyone in his room or change\n\nthe linen.", "In two hours, Citizen Homeless will be back here.", "So, then,\u2019 he\n\nturned to the poet, \u2018I won\u2019t wish you success, because I don\u2019t believe one\n\niota in that success.", "See you soon!\u2019 He stood up, and his retinue stirred.", "\u2018On what grounds will I be back here?\u2019 Ivan asked anxiously.", "Stravinsky was as if waiting for this question, immediately sat down, and\n\nbegan to speak:\n\n\u2018On the grounds that as soon as you show up at the police station in your\n\ndrawers and tell them you\u2019ve seen a man who knew Pontius Pilate\n\npersonally, you\u2019ll instantly be brought here, and you\u2019ll find yourself again\n\nin this very same room.\u2019\n\n\u2018What have drawers got to do with it?\u2019 Ivan asked, gazing around in\n\nbewilderment.", "\u2018It\u2019s mainly Pontius Pilate.", "But the drawers, too.", "Because we\u2019ll take the\n\nclinic underwear from you and give you back your clothes.", "And you were\n\ndelivered here in your drawers.", "And yet you were by no means going to\n\nstop at your place, though I dropped you a hint.", "Then comes Pilate ... and\n\nthat\u2019s it.\u2019\n\nHere something strange happened with Ivan Nikolaevich.", "His will\n\nseemed to crack, and he felt himself weak, in need of advice.", "\u2018What am I to do, then?\u2019 he asked, timidly this time.", "\u2018Well, how very nice!\u2019 Stravinsky replied.", "\u2018A most reasonable question.", "Now I am going to tell you what actually happened to you.", "Yesterday\n\nsomeone frightened you badly and upset you with a story about Pontius\n\nPilate and other things.", "And so you, a very nervous and high-strung man,\n\nstarted going around the city, telling about Pontius Pilate.", "It\u2019s quite natural\n\nthat you\u2019re taken for a madman.", "Your salvation now lies in just one thing -\n\ncomplete peace.", "And you absolutely must remain here.\u2019\n\n\u2018But he has to be caught!\u2019 Ivan exclaimed, imploringly now.", "\u2018Very good, sir, but why should you go running around yourself?", "Explain\n\nall your suspicions and accusations against this man on paper.", "Nothing\n\ncould be simpler than to send your declaration to

the\n\ntelephone started to ring, Varenukha would pick up the receiver and lie into\n\nit:\n\n\u2018Who?", "Varenukha?", "He\u2019s not here.", "He stepped out.\u2019\n\n\u2018Please call Likhodeev

clacking on the adding\n\nmachine.", "The door opened and an usher dragged in a thick stack of freshly printed\n\nextra posters; in big red letters on a green background was printed:\n\nToday and Every Day at the Variety Theatre\n\nan Additional Programme\n\nPROFESSOR WOLAND\n\nSeances of Black Magic and its Full Exposure\n\nVarenukha stepped back from the poster, which he had thrown on to the\n\nscale model, admired it, and told the usher to send all the posters out\n\nimmediately to be pasted up.", "\u2018Good ...", "Loud!\u2019 Varenukha observed on the usher\u2019s departure.", "\u2018And I dislike this undertaking extremely,\u2019 Rimsky grumbled, glancing\n\nspitefully at the poster through his horn-rimmed glasses, \u2018and generally I\u2019m\n\nsurprised he\u2019s been allowed to present it.\u2019\n\n\u2018No, Grigory Danilovich, don\u2019t say so!", "This is a very subtle step.", "The salt\n\nis all in the exposure.\u2019\n\n\u2018I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t

up, devil knows!\u2019\n\nIt turned out that Varenukha had not seen the magician any more than\n\nRimsky had.", "Yesterday Styopa had come running (\u2018like crazy\u2019, in Rimsky\u2019s\n\nexpression) to the findirector with the already written draft of a contract,\n\nordered it copied straight away and the money handed over to Woland.", "And\n\nthis magician had cleared out, and no one had seen him except Styopa\n\nhimself.", "Rimsky took out his watch, saw that it read five minutes past two, and\n\nflew into a complete rage.", "Really!", "Likhodeev had called at around eleven,\n\nsaid he\u2019d come in half an hour, and not only had not come, but had\n\ndisappeared from his apartment.", "\u2018He\u2019s holding up my business!\u2019 Rimsky was roaring now, jabbing his\n\nfinger at a pile of unsigned papers.", "\u2018Might he have fallen under a tram-car like Berlioz?\u2019 Varenukha said as\n\nhe held his ear to the receiver, from which came low, prolonged and utterly\n\nhopeless signals.", "\u2018Wouldn\u2019t be a bad thing ...\u2019 Rimsky said barely audibly through his\n\nteeth.", "At that same moment a woman in a uniform jacket, visored cap, black\n\nskirt and sneakers came into the office.", "From a small pouch at her belt the\n\nwoman took a small white square and a notebook and asked:\n\n\u2018Who here is Variety?", "A super-lightning telegram.", "2 Sign here.\u2019\n\nVarenukha scribbled some flourish in the woman\u2019s notebook, and as soon\n\nas the door slammed behind her, he opened the square.",

might\n\ncall, the same woman who had brought the first telegram came in and\n\nhanded Varenukha a new envelope.", "Opening it hurriedly, Varenukha read\n\nthe message and whistled.", "\u2018What now?\u2019 Rimsky asked, twitching nervously.", "Varenukha silently handed him the telegram, and the findirector saw\n\nthere the words: \u2018Beg believe thrown Yalta Woland hypnosis wire

crooked\n\nscrawl in the notebook, and the woman vanished.", "\u2018Didn\u2019t you talk with him on the phone at a little past eleven?\u2019 the\n\nadministrator began in total bewilderment.",

"\u2018Who\u2019s drunk?\u2019 asked Rimsky, and again the two stared at each other.", "That some impostor or madman had sent telegrams from Yalta, there was\n\nno doubt.", "But the strange thing was this: how did the Yalta mystifier know\n\nWoland, who had come to Moscow just the day before?", "How did he know\n\nabout the connection between Likhodeev and Woland?", "\u2018Hypnosis...\u2019 Varenukha kept repeating the word from the telegram.", "\u2018How does he know about Woland?\u2019 He blinked his eyes and suddenly cried\n\nresolutely: \u2018Ah, no!", "Nonsense!", "...", "Nonsense, nonsense!\u2019\n\n\u2018Where\u2019s he staying, this Woland, devil take him?\u2019 asked Rimsky.", "Varenukha immediately got connected with the foreign tourist bureau\n\nand, to Rimsky\u2019s utter astonishment, announced that Woland was staying in\n\nLikhodeev\u2019s apartment.", "Dialling the number of the Likhodeev apartment\n\nafter that, Varenukha listened for a long time to the low buzzing in the\n\nreceiver.", "Amidst the buzzing, from somewhere far away, came a heavy,\n\ngloomy voice singing: \u2018... rocks, my refuge...\u20194 and Varenukha decided that\n\nthe telephone lines had crossed with a voice from a radio show.", "\u2018The apartment doesn\u2019t answer,\u2019 Varenukha said, putting down the\n\nreceiver, \u2018or maybe I should call ...\u2019\n\nHe did not finish.", "The same woman appeared in the door, and both men,\n\nRimsky and Varenukha, rose to meet her, while she took from her pouch not\n\na white sheet this time, but some sort of dark one.", "This is beginning to get interesting,\u2018 Varenukha said through his teeth, his\n\neyes following the hurriedly departing woman.", "Rimsky was the first to take\n\nhold of the sheet.", "On a dark background of photographic paper, some black handwritten\n\nlines were barely discernible:\n\n\u2018Proof my handwriting my signature wire urgently confirmation place\n\nsecret watch Woland Likhodeev.\u2019\n\nIn his twenty years of work in the theatre, Varenukha had seen all kinds\n\nof sights, but here he felt his mind becoming obscured as with a veil, and he\n\ncould find nothing to say but the at once mundane and utterly absurd\n\nphrase:\n\n\u2018This cannot be!\u2019\n\nRimsky acted otherwise.", "He stood up, opened the door, barked out to the\n\nmessenger girl sitting on a stool:\n\n\u2018Let no one in except postmen!\u2019 \u2014 and locked the door with a key.", "Then he took a pile of papers out of the desk and began carefully to\n\ncompare the bold, back-slanting letters of the photogram with the letters in\n\nStyopa\u2019s resolutions and signatures, furnished with a corkscrew flourish.", "Varenukha, leaning his weight on the table, breathed hotly on Rimsky\u2019s\n\ncheek.", "\u2018It\u2019s his handwriting,\u2019 the findirector finally said firmly, and Varenukha\n\nrepeated like an echo:\n\n\u2018His.\u2019\n\nPeering into Rimsky\u2019s face, the administrator marvelled at the change\n\nthat had come over this face.", "Thin to begin with, the findirector seemed to\n\nhave grown still thinner and even older, his eyes in their horn rims had lost\n\ntheir customary prickliness, and there appeared in them not only alarm, but\n\neven sorrow.", "Varenukha did everything that a man in a moment of great astonishment\n\nought to do.", "He raced up and down the office, he raised his arms twice like\n\none crucified, he drank a whole glass of yellowish water from the carafe\n\nand exclaimed:\n\n\u2018I don\u2019t understand!", "I don\u2019t understand!", "I don\u2019t un-der-stand!\u2019\n\nRimsky meanwhile was looking out the window, thinking hard about\n\nsomething.", "The findirector\u2019s position was very difficult.", "It was necessary at\n\nonce, right on the spot, to invent ordinary explanations for extraordinary\n\nphenomena.", "Narrowing his eyes, the findirector pictured to himself Styopa, in a\n\nnightshirt and shoeless, getting into some unprecedented super-highspeed\n\nairplane at around half past eleven that morning, and then the same Styopa,\n\nalso at half past eleven, standing in his stocking feet at the airport in Yalta ...\n\ndevil knew what to make of it!", "Maybe it was not Styopa who talked with him this morning over the\n\nphone from his own apartment?", "No, it was Styopa speaking!", "Who if not he\n\nshould know Styopa\u2019s voice?", "And even if it was not Styopa speaking today,\n\nit was no earlier than yesterday, towards evening, that Styopa had come\n\nfrom his office to this very office with this idiotic contract and annoyed the\n\nfindirector with his light-mindedness.", "How could he have gone or flown\n\naway without leaving word at the theatre?", "But if he had flown away\n\nyesterday evening - he would not have arrived by noon today.", "Or would he?", "\u2018How many miles is it to Yalta?\u2019 asked Rimsky.", "Varenukha stopped his running and yelled:\n\n\u2018I thought of that!", "I already thought of it!", "By train it\u2019s over nine hundred\n\nmiles to Sebastopol, plus another fifty to Yalta!", "Well, but by air, of course,\n\nit\u2019s less.\u2019\n\nHm ...", "Yes ...", "There could be no question of any trains.", "But what then?", "Some fighter plane?", "Who would let Styopa on any fighter plane without his\n\nshoes?", "What for?", "Maybe he took his shoes off when he got to Yalta?", "It\u2019s the\n\nsame thing: what for?", "And even with his shoes on they wouldn\u2019t have let\n\nhim on a fighter!", "And what has the fighter got to do with it?", "It\u2019s written that\n\nhe came to the investigators at half past eleven in the morning, and he\n\ntalked on the telephone in Moscow ... excuse me ... (the face of Rimsky\u2019s\n\nwatch emerged before his eyes).", "Rimsky tried to remember where the hands had been ...", "Terrible!", "It had\n\nbeen twenty minutes past eleven!", "So what does it boil down to?", "If one supposes that after the conversation\n\nStyopa instantly rushed to the airport, and reached it in, say, five minutes\n\n(which, incidentally, was also unthinkable), it means that the plane, taking\n\noff at once, covered nearly a thousand miles in five minutes.", "Consequently,\n\nit was flying at twelve thousand miles an hour!!!", "That cannot be, and that\n\nmeans he\u2019s not in Yalta!", "What remains, then?", "Hypnosis?", "There\u2019s no hypnosis in the world that can\n\nfling a man a thousand miles away!", "So he\u2019s imagining that he\u2019s in Yalta?", "He\n\nmay be imagining it, but are the Yalta investigators also imagining it?", "No,\n\nno, sorry, that can\u2019t be!", "...", "Yet they did telegraph from there?", "The findirector\u2019s face was literally dreadful.", "The door handle was all the\n\nwhile being turned and pulled from outside, and the messenger girl could be\n\nheard through the door crying desperately:\n\n\u2018Impossible!", "I won\u2019t let you!", "Cut me to pieces!", "It\u2019s a meeting!\u2019\n\nRimsky regained control of himself as well as he could, took the receiver\n\nof the phone, and said into it:\n\n\u2018A super-urgent call to Yalta, please.\u2019\n\n\u2018Clever!\u2019 Varenukha observed mentally.", "But the conversation with Yalta did not take place.", "Rimsky hung up the\n\nreceiver and said:\n\n\u2018As luck would have it, the line\u2019s broken.\u2019\n\nIt could be seen that the broken line especially upset him for some\n\nreason, and even made him lapse into thought.", "Having thought a little, he\n\nagain took the receiver in one hand, and with the other began writing down\n\nwhat he said into it:\n\nTake a super-lightning.", "Variety.", "Yes.", "Yalta criminal investigation.", "Yes.", "\u201cToday around eleven thirty Likhodeev talked me phone Moscow stop\n\nAfter that did not come work unable locate by phone stop Confirm\n\nhandwriting stop Taking measures

can\u2019t be in Yalta!\u2019\n\nRimsky meanwhile did the following: he neatly stacked all the received\n\ntelegrams, plus the copy of his own, put the stack into an envelope, sealed\n\nit, wrote a few words on it, and handed it to Varenukha, saying:\n\n\u2018Go right now, Ivan Savelyevich, take it there personally.5 Let them sort\n\nit out.\u2019\n\n\u2018Now that is really clever!\u2019 thought Varenukha, and he put the envelope\n\ninto his briefcase.", "Then, just in case, he dialled Styopa\u2019s apartment number\n\non the telephone, listened, and began winking and grimacing joyfully and\n\nmysteriously.", "Rimsky stretched his neck.", "\u2018May I speak with the artiste Woland?\u2019 Varenukha asked sweetly.", "\u2018Mister\u2019s busy,\u2019 the receiver answered in a rattling voice, \u2018who\u2019s calling?\u2019\n\nThe administrator of the Variety, Varenukha.\u2018\n\n\u2018Ivan Savelyevich?\u2019 the receiver cried out joyfully.", "Terribly glad to hear\n\nyour

is Stepan Bogdanovich Likhodeev not at home\n\nnow?\u2019\n\n\u2018Alas, no!", "No!\u2019 the receiver shouted.", "\u2018He left!\u2019\n\n\u2018For where?\u2019\n\n\u2018Out of town, for a drive in the car.\u2019\n\n\u2018Wh ... what?", "A dr ... drive?", "And when will he be back?\u2019\n\n\u2018He said, I\u2019ll get a breath of fresh air and come back.\u2019\n\n\u2018So ...\u2019 said the puzzled Varenukha, \u2018merci ... kindly tell Monsieur\n\nWoland that his performance is tonight in the third part of the programme.\u2019\n\n\u2018Right.", "Of course.", "Absolutely.", "Urgently.", "Without fail.", "I\u2019ll tell him,\u2019 the\n\nreceiver rapped out abruptly.", "\u2018Goodbye,\u2019 Varenukha said in astonishment.", "\u2018Please accept,\u2019 said the receiver, \u2018my best, warmest greetings and\n\nwishes!", "For success!", "Luck!", "Complete happiness!", "Everything!\u2019\n\nBut of course!", "Didn\u2019t I say so!\u2018 the administrator cried agitatedly.", "\u2019It\u2019s\n\nnot any Yalta, he just went to the country!\u2018\n\n\u2018Well, if that\u2019s so,\u2019 the findirector began, turning pale with anger, \u2018it\u2019s\n\nreal swinishness, there\u2019s even no name for it!\u2019\n\nHere the administrator jumped up and shouted so that Rimsky gave a\n\nstart:\n\n\u2018I remember!", "I remember!", "They\u2019ve opened a new Georgian tavern in\n\nPushkino called \u201cYalta\u201d!", "It\u2019s all clear!", "He went there, got drunk, and now\n\nhe\u2019s sending telegrams from there!\u2019\n\n\u2018Well, now that\u2019s too much!\u2019 Rimsky answered, his cheek twitching, and\n\ndeep, genuine anger burned in his eyes.", "\u2018Well, then, he\u2019s going to pay\n\ndearly for this little excursion!", "...\u2019 He suddenly faltered and added\n\nirresolutely: \u2018But what about the criminal investlgation ...\u2019\n\n\u2018It\u2019s nonsense!", "His own little jokes,\u2019 the expansive administrator\n\ninterrupted, and asked: \u2018Shall I take the envelope?\u2019\n\n\u2018Absolutely,\u2019 replied Rimsky.", "And again the door opened and in came that same ... \u2018Her!\u2019 thought\n\nRimsky, for some reason with anguish.", "And both men rose to meet the\n\npostwoman.", "This time the telegram contained the words:\n\n\u2018Thank you confirmation send five hundred urgently criminal\n\ninvestigation my name tomorrow fly Moscow Likhodeev.\u2019\n\n\u2018He\u2019s lost his mind ...\u2019 Varenukha said weakly.", "Rimsky jingled his key, took money from the fireproof safe, counted out\n\nfive hundred roubles, rang the bell, handed the messenger the money, and\n\nsent him to the telegraph office.", "\u2018Good heavens, Grigory Danilovich,\u2019 Varenukha said, not believing his\n\neyes, \u2018in my opinion you oughtn\u2019t to send the money.\u2019\n\n\u2018It\u2019ll come back,\u2019 Rimsky replied quietly, \u2018but he\u2019ll have a hard time\n\nexplaining this little picnic.\u2019 And he added, indicating the briefcase to\n\nVarenukha: \u2018Go, Ivan Savelyevich, don\u2019t delay.\u2019\n\nAnd Varenukha ran out of the office with the briefcase.", "He went down to the ground floor, saw the longest line at the box office,\n\nfound out from the box-office girl that she expected to sell out within the\n\nhour, because the public was simply pouring in since the additional poster\n\nhad been put up, told the girl to earmark and hold thirty of the best seats in\n\nthe gallery and the stalls, popped out of the box office, shook off\n\nimportunate pass-seekers as he ran, and dived into his little office to get his\n\ncap.", "At that moment the telephone rattled.", "\u2018Yes!\u2019 Varenukha shouted.", "\u2018Ivan Savelyevich?\u2019 the receiver inquired in a most repulsive nasal voice.", "\u2018He\u2019s not in the theatre!\u2019 Varenukha was shouting, but the receiver\n\ninterrupted him at once:\n\n\u2018Don\u2019t play the fool, Ivan Savelyevich, just listen.", "Do not take those\n\ntelegrams anywhere or show them to anyone.\u2019\n\n\u2018Who is this?\u2019 Varenukha bellowed.", "\u2018Stop these jokes, citizen!", "You\u2019ll be\n\nfound out at once!", "What\u2019s your number?\u2019\n\n\u2018Varenukha,\u2019 the same nasty voice returned, \u2018do you understand Russian?", "Don\u2019t take the telegrams anywhere.\u2019\n\n\u2018Ah, so you won\u2019t stop?\u2019 the administrator cried furiously.", "\u2018Look out,\n\nthen!", "You\u2019re going to pay for it!\u2019 He shouted some other threat, but fell\n\nsilent, because he sensed that no one was listening to him any longer in the\n\nreceiver.", "Here it somehow began to grow dark very quickly in his little office.", "Varenukha ran out, slammed the door behind him, and rushed through the\n\nside entrance into the summer garden.", "The administrator was agitated and full of energy.", "After the insolent\n\nphone call he had no doubts that it was a band of hooligans playing nasty\n\ntricks, and that these tricks were connected with the disappearance of\n\nLikhodeev.", "The administrator was choking with the desire to expose the\n\nmalefactors, and, strange as it was, the anticipation of something enjoyable\n\nwas born in him.", "It happens that way when a man strives to become the\n\ncentre of attention, to bring sensational news somewhere.", "In the garden the wind blew in the administrator\u2019s face and flung sand in\n\nhis eyes, as if blocking his way, as if cautioning him.", "A window on the\n\nsecond floor slammed so that the glass nearly broke, the tops of the maples\n\nand lindens rustled alarmingly.", "It became darker and colder.", "The\n\nadministrator rubbed his eyes and saw that a yellow-bellied storm cloud\n\nwas creeping low over Moscow.", "There came a dense, distant rumbling.", "However great Varenukha\u2019s hurry, an irrepressible desire pulled at him to\n\nrun over to the summer toilet for a second on his way, to check whether the\n\nrepairman had put a wire screen over the light-bulb.", "Running past the shooting gallery, Varenukha came to a thick growth of\n\nlilacs where the light-blue toilet building stood.", "The repairman turned out to\n\nbe an efficient fellow, the bulb under the roof of the gentlemen\u2019s side was\n\ncovered with a wire screen, but the administrator was upset that even in the\n\npre-storm darkness one could make out that the walls were already written\n\nall over in charcoal and pencil.", "\u2018Well, what sort of...\u2019 the administrator began and suddenly heard a voice\n\npurring behind him:\n\n\u2018Is that you, Ivan Savelyevich?\u2019\n\nVarenukha started, turned around, and saw before him a short, fat man\n\nwith what seemed to him a cat-like physiognomy.", "\u2018So, it\u2019s me, Varenukha answered hostilely.\u2019\n\n\u2018Very, very glad,\u2019 the cat-like fat man responded in a squeaky voice and,\n\nsuddenly swinging his arm, gave Varenukha such a blow on the ear that the\n\ncap flew off the administrator\u2019s head and vanished without a trace down the\n\nhole in the seat.", "At the fat man\u2019s blow, the whole toilet lit up momentarily with a\n\ntremulous light, and a roll of thunder echoed in the sky.", "Then came another\n\nflash and a second man emerged before the administrator \u2014 short, but with\n\nathletic shoulders, hair red as fire, albugo in one eye, a fang in his mouth ...", "This second one, evidently a lefty, socked the administrator on the other ear.", "In response there was another roll of thunder in the sky, and rain poured\n\ndown on the wooden roof of the toilet.", "\u2018What is it, comr ...\u2019 the half-crazed administrator whispered, realized at\n\nonce that the word \u2018comrades\u2019 hardly fitted bandits attacking a man in a\n\npublic toilet, rasped out: \u2019citiz ...\u2018 \u2014 figured that they did not merit this\n\nappellation either, and received a third terrible blow from he did not know\n\nwhich of them, so that blood gushed from his nose on to his Tolstoy blouse.", "\u2018What you got in the briefcase, parasite?\u2019 the one resembling a cat cried\n\nshrilly.", "\u2018Telegrams?", "Weren\u2019t you warned over the phone not to take them\n\nanywhere?", "Weren\u2019t you warned, I\u2019m asking you?\u2019\n\n\u2018I was wor ... wer ... warned ...\u2019 the administrator answered, suffocating.", "\u2018And you skipped off anyway?", "Gimme the briefcase, vermin!\u2019 the second\n\none cried in the same nasal voice that had come over the telephone, and he\n\nyanked the briefcase from Varenukha\u2019s trembling hands.", "And the two picked the administrator up under the arms, dragged him out\n\nof the garden, and raced down Sadovaya with him.", "The storm raged at full\n\nforce, water streamed with a noise and howling down the drains, waves\n\nbubbled and billowed everywhere, water gushed from the roofs past the\n\ndrainpipes, foamy streams ran from gateways.", "Everything living got washed\n\noff Sadovaya, and there was no one to save Ivan Savelyevich.", "Leaping\n\nthrough muddy rivers, under flashes of lightning, the bandits dragged

with a\n\nphosphorescent gleam.", "Varenukha understood that this was the most terrible of all things that had\n\never happened to him and, moaning, recoiled against the wall.", "But the girl\n\ncame right up to the administrator and placed the palms of her hands on his\n\nshoulders.", "Varenukha\u2019s hair stood on end, because even through the cold,\n\nwater-soaked cloth of his Tolstoy blouse

room\n\nwas flooded with a tremulous, frightening light.", "Ivan quietly wept, sitting on his bed and looking out at the muddy river\n\nboiling with bubbles.", "At every clap of thunder, he cried out pitifully and\n\nburied his face in his hands.", "Pages covered with Ivan\u2019s writing lay about on\n\nthe floor.", "They had been blown down by the wind that flew into the room\n\nbefore the storm began.", "The poet\u2019s attempts to write a statement concerning the terrible\n\nconsultant had gone nowhere.", "As soon as he got the pencil stub and paper\n\nfrom the fat attendant, whose name was

A. Berlioz, subsequently\n\ndeceased...\u2019 This did not satisfy the author either.", "He had to have recourse\n\nto a third redaction, which proved still worse than the first two: \u2018Berlioz,\n\nwho fell under the tram-car ...\u2019 \u2014 and that namesake composer, unknown to\n\nanyone, was also dangling here, so he had to put in: \u2018not the composer...\u2019\n\nAfter suffering over these two Berliozes, Ivan crossed it all out and\n\ndecided to begin right off with something very strong, in order to attract the\n\nreader\u2019s attention at once, so he wrote that a cat had got on a tram-car, and\n\nthen went back to the episode with the severed head.", "The head and the\n\nconsultant\u2019s prediction led him to the thought of Pontius Pilate, and for\n\ngreater conviction Ivan decided to tell the whole story of the procurator in\n\nfull, from the moment he walked out in his white cloak with blood-red\n\nlining to the colonnade of Herod\u2019s palace.", "Ivan worked assiduously, crossing out what he had written, putting in\n\nnew words, and even attempted to draw Pontius Pilate and then a cat\n\nstanding on its hind legs.", "But the drawings did not help, and the further it\n\nwent, the more confusing and incomprehensible the poet\u2019s statement\n\nbecame.", "By the time the frightening cloud with smoking edges appeared from far\n\noff and covered the woods, and the wind began to blow, Ivan felt that he\n\nwas strengthless, that he would never be able to manage with the statement,\n\nand he would not pick up the scattered pages, and he wept quietly and\n\nbitterly.", "The good-natured nurse Praskovya Fyodorovna visited the poet\n\nduring the storm, became alarmed on seeing him weeping, closed the blinds\n\nso that the lightning would not frighten the patient, picked up the pages\n\nfrom the floor, and ran with them for the doctor.", "He came, gave Ivan an injection in the arm, and assured him that he\n\nwould not weep any more, that

the\n\nrainbow that stretched across the sky.", "So it went till evening, and he did not even notice how the rainbow\n\nmelted away, how the sky saddened and faded, how the woods turned black.", "Having drunk some hot milk, Ivan lay down again and marvelled himself\n\nat how changed his thinking was.", "The accursed, demonic cat somehow\n\nsoftened in his memory, the severed head did not frighten him any more,\n\nand, abandoning all thought of it, Ivan began to reflect that, essentially, it\n\nwas not so bad in the clinic, that Stravinsky was a clever man and a famous\n\none, and it was quite pleasant to deal with him.", "Besides, the evening air was\n\nsweet and fresh after the storm.", "The house of sorrow was falling asleep.", "In quiet corridors the frosted\n\nwhite lights went out, and in their place, according to regulations, faint blue\n\nnight-lights were lit, and the careful steps of attendants were heard more\n\nand more rarely on the rubber matting of the corridor outside the door.", "Now Ivan lay in sweet languor, glancing at the lamp under its shade,\n\nshedding a softened light from the ceiling, then at the moon rising behind\n\nthe black woods, and conversed with himself.", "\u2018Why, actually, did I get so excited about Berlioz falling under a tram-\n\ncar?\u2019 the poet reasoned.", "\u2018In the final analysis, let him sink!", "What am I, in\n\nfact, his chum or in-law?", "If we air the question properly, it turns out that, in\n\nessence, I really did not even know the deceased.", "What, indeed, did I know\n\nabout him?", "Nothing except that he was bald and terribly eloquent.", "And\n\nfurthermore, citizens,\u2019 Ivan continued his speech, addressing someone or\n\nother, \u2018let\u2019s sort this out: why, tell me, did I get furious at this mysterious\n\nconsultant, magician and professor with the black and empty eye?", "Why all\n\nthis absurd chase after him in underpants and with a candle in my hand, and\n\nthen those wild shenanigans in the restaurant?\u2019\n\n\u2018Uh-uh-uh!\u2019 the former Ivan suddenly said sternly somewhere, either\n\ninside or over his ear, to the new Ivan.", "\u2018He did know beforehand

Ivan.", "That things are not quite proper here, even a child can\n\nunderstand.", "He\u2019s a one-hundred-per-cent outstanding and mysterious\n\nperson!", "But that\u2019s the most interesting thing!", "The man was personally\n\nacquainted with Pontius Pilate, what could be more interesting than that?", "And, instead of raising a stupid rumpus at the Ponds, wouldn\u2019t it have been\n\nmore intelligent to question him politely about what happened further on\n\nwith Pilate and his prisoner Ha-Nozri?", "And I started devil knows what!", "A\n\nmajor occurrence, really \u2014 a magazine editor gets run over!", "And so, what,\n\nis the magazine going to shut down for that?", "Well, what can be done about\n\nit?", "Man is mortal and, as has rightly been said, unexpectedly mortal.", "Well,\n\nmay he rest in peace!", "Well, so there\u2019ll be another editor, and maybe even\n\nmore eloquent than the previous one!\u2018\n\nAfter dozing for a while, the new Ivan asked the old Ivan sarcastically:\n\n\u2018And what does it make me, in that case?\u2019\n\n\u2018A fool!\u2019 a bass voice said distinctly somewhere, a voice not belonging to\n\neither of the Ivans and extremely like the bass of the consultant.", "Ivan, for some reason not offended by the word \u2018fool\u2019, but even\n\npleasantly surprised at it, smiled and drowsily grew quiet.", "Sleep was\n\nstealing over Ivan, and he was already picturing a palm tree on its\n\nelephant\u2019s leg, and a cat passing by - not scary, but merry \u2014 and, in short,\n\nsleep was just about to come over Ivan, when the grille suddenly moved\n\nnoiselessly aside, and a mysterious figure appeared on the balcony, hiding\n\nfrom the moonlight, and shook its finger at Ivan.", "Not frightened in the least, Ivan sat up in bed and saw that there was a\n\nman on the balcony.", "And this man, pressing a finger to his lips, whispered:\n\n\u2018Shhh!...\u2019\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 12\n\nBlack Magic and Its Exposure\n\n1 A small man in a yellow bowler-hat full of holes and with a pear-shaped,\n\nraspberry-coloured nose, in checkered trousers and patent-leather shoes,\n\nrolled out on to the stage of the Variety on an ordinary two-wheeled bicycle.", "To the sounds of a foxtrot he made a circle, and then gave a triumphant\n\nshout, which caused his bicycle to rear up.", "After riding around on the back\n\nwheel, the little man turned upside down, contrived while in motion to\n\nunscrew the front wheel and send it backstage, and then proceeded on his\n\nway with one wheel, turning the pedals with his hands.", "On a tall metal pole with a seat at the top and a single wheel, a plump\n\nblonde rolled out in tights and a little skirt strewn with silver stars, and\n\nbegan riding in a circle.", "As he met her, the little man uttered cries of\n\ngreeting, doffing his bowler-hat with his foot.", "Finally, a little eight-year-old with an elderly face came rolling out and\n\nbegan scooting about among the adults on a tiny two-wheeler furnished\n\nwith an enormous automobile horn.", "After making several loops, the whole company, to the alarming drum-\n\nbeats of the orchestra, rolled to the very edge of the stage, and the\n\nspectators in the front rows gasped and drew back, because it seemed to the\n\npublic that the whole trio with its vehicles was about to crash down into the\n\norchestra pit.", "But the bicycles stopped just at the moment when the front wheels\n\nthreatened to slide into the abyss on the heads of the musicians.", "With a loud\n\nshout of \u2018Hup!\u2019 the cyclists jumped off their vehicles and bowed, the blonde\n\nwoman blowing kisses to the public, and the little one tooting a funny\n\nsignal on his horn.", "Applause shook the building, the light-blue curtain came from both sides\n\nand covered the cyclists, the green \u2018Exit\u2019 lights by the doors went out, and\n\nin the web of trapezes under the cupola white spheres lit up like the sun.", "It\n\nwas the intermission before the last part.", "The only man who was not the least bit interested in the wonders of the\n\nGiulli family\u2019s cycling technique was Grigory Danilovich Rimsky.", "In\n\ncomplete solitude he sat in his office, biting his thin lips, a spasm passing\n\nover his face from time to time.", "To the extraordinary disappearance of\n\nLikhodeev had now been added the wholly unforeseen disappearance of\n\nVarenukha.", "Rimsky knew where he had gone, but he had gone and ... not come back!", "Rimsky shrugged his shoulders and whispered to himself:\n\n\u2018But what for?\u2019\n\nAnd it was strange: for such a practical man as the findirector, the\n\nsimplest thing would, of course, have been to call the place where\n\nVarenukha had gone and find out what had befallen him, yet until ten\n\no\u2018clock at night he had been unable to force himself to do it.", "At ten, doing outright violence to himself, Rimsky picked up the receiver\n\nand here discovered that his telephone was dead.", "The messenger reported\n\nthat the other telephones in the building were also out of order.", "This\n\ncertainly unpleasant, though hardly supernatural, occurrence for some\n\nreason thoroughly shocked the findirector, but at the same time he was glad:\n\nthe need to call fell away.", "Just as the red light over the findirector\u2019s head lit up and blinked,\n\nannouncing the beginning of the intermission, a messenger came in and\n\ninformed him of the foreign artiste\u2019s arrival.", "The findirector cringed for\n\nsome reason, and, blacker than a storm cloud, went backstage to receive the\n\nvisitor, since there was no one else to receive him.", "Under various pretexts, curious people kept peeking into the big dressing\n\nroom from the corridor, where the signal bell was already ringing.", "Among\n\nthem were conjurers in bright robes and turbans, a skater in a white knitted\n\njacket, a storyteller pale with powder and the make-up man.", "The newly arrived celebrity struck everyone by his marvellously cut\n\ntailcoat, of a length never seen before, and by his having come in a black\n\nhalf-mask.", "But most remarkable of all were the black magician\u2019s two\n\ncompanions: a long checkered one with a cracked pince-nez, and a fat black\n\ncat who came into the dressing room on his hind legs and quite\n\nnonchalantly sat on the sofa squinting at the bare make-up lights.", "Rimsky attempted to produce a smile on his face, which made it look\n\nsour and spiteful, and bowed to the silent black magician, who was seated\n\non the sofa beside the cat.", "There was no handshake.", "Instead, the easygoing\n\ncheckered one made his own introductions to the findirector, calling himself\n\n\u2018the gent\u2019s assistant\u2019.", "This circumstance surprised the findirector, and\n\nunpleasantly so: there was decidedly no mention of any assistant in the\n\ncontract.", "Quite stiffly and drily, Grigory Danilovich inquired of this fallen-from-\n\nthe-sky checkered one where the artiste\u2019s paraphernalia was.", "\u2018Our heavenly diamond, most precious mister director,\u2019 the magician\u2019s\n\nassistant replied in a rattling voice, \u2018the paraphernalia is always with us.", "Here it is!", "Ein, zwei, drei!\u2019 And, waving his knotty fingers before Rimsky\u2019s\n\neyes, he suddenly took from behind the cat\u2019s ear Rimsky\u2019s own gold watch\n\nand chain, hitherto worn by the findirector in his waistcoat pocket, under\n\nhis buttoned coat, with the chain through a buttonhole.", "Rimsky inadvertently clutched his stomach, those present gasped, and the\n\nmake-up man, peeking in the doorway, grunted approvingly.", "\u2018Your little watchie?", "Kindly take it,\u2019 the checkered one said, smiling\n\ncasually and offering the bewildered Rimsky his own property on a dirty\n\npalm.", "\u2018No getting on a tram with that one,\u2019 the storyteller whispered quietly and\n\nmerrily to the make-up man.", "But the cat pulled a neater trick than the number with the stolen watch.", "Getting up from the sofa unexpectedly, he walked on his hind legs to the\n\ndressing table, pulled the stopper out of the carafe with his front paw,\n\npoured water into a glass, drank it, installed the stopper in its place, and\n\nwiped his whiskers with a make-up cloth.", "Here no one even gasped, their mouths simply fell open, and the make-up\n\nman whispered admiringly:\n\n\u2018That\u2019s class!\u2019\n\nJust then the bells rang alarmingly for the third time, and everyone,\n\nagitated and anticipating an interesting number, thronged out of the dressing\n\nroom.", "A moment later the spheres went out in the theatre, the footlights blazed\n\nup, lending a reddish glow to the base of the curtain, and in the lighted gap\n\nof the curtain there appeared before the public a plump man, merry as a\n\nbaby, with a clean-shaven face, in a rumpled tailcoat and none-too-fresh\n\nshirt.", "This was the master of ceremonies, well known to all Moscow -\n\nGeorges Bengalsky.", "\u2018And now, citizens,\u2019 Bengalsky began, smiling his baby smile, \u2018there is\n\nabout to come before you ...\u2019 Here Bengalsky interrupted himself and spoke\n\nin a different tone: \u2018I see the audience has grown for the third part.", "We\u2019ve\n\ngot half the city here!", "I met a friend the other day and said to him: \u201cWhy\n\ndon\u2019t you come to our show?", "Yesterday we had half the city.\u201d And he says\n\nto me: \u201cI live in the other half!\u201d \u2019 Bengalsky paused, waiting for a burst of\n\nlaughter, but as no one laughed, he went on: \u2018... And so, now comes the\n\nfamous foreign artiste, Monsieur Woland, with a seance of black magic.", "Well, both you and I know,\u2019 here Bengalsky smiled a wise smile, \u2018that\n\nthere\u2019s no such thing in the world, and that it\u2019s all just superstition, and\n\nMaestro Woland is simply a perfect master of the technique of conjuring, as\n\nwe shall see from the most interesting part, that is, the exposure of this\n\ntechnique, and since we\u2019re all of us to a man both for technique and for its\n\nexposure, let\u2019s bring on Mr Woland!", "...\u2019\n\nAfter uttering all this claptrap, Bengalsky pressed his palms together and\n\nwaved them in greeting through the slit of the curtain, which caused it to\n\npart with a soft rustle.", "The entrance of the magician with his long assistant and the cat, who\n\ncame on stage on his hind legs, pleased the audience greatly.", "\u2018An armchair for me,\u2019 Woland ordered in a low voice, and that same\n\nsecond an armchair appeared on stage, no one knew how or from where, in\n\nwhich the magician sat down.", "Tell me, my gentle Fagott,\u2018 Woland inquired\n\nof the checkered clown, who evidently had another appellation than\n\nKoroviev, \u2019what do you think, the Moscow populace has changed\n\nsignificantly, hasn\u2019t it?\u2018\n\nThe magician looked out at the hushed audience, struck by the\n\nappearance of the armchair out of nowhere.", "\u2018That it has, Messire,\u2019 Fagott-Koroviev replied in a low voice.", "\u2018You\u2019re right.", "The city folk have changed greatly ... externally, that is ...\n\nas has the city itself, incidentally ... Not to mention their clothing, these ...\n\nwhat do you call them ... trams, automobiles ... have appeared ...\u2019\n\n\u2018Buses...\u2019 Fagott prompted deferentially.", "The audience listened attentively to this conversation, thinking it\n\nconstituted a prelude to the magic tricks.", "The wings were packed with\n\nperformers and stage-hands, and among their faces could be seen the tense,\n\npale face of Rimsky.", "The physiognomy of Bengalsky, who had retreated to the side of the\n\nstage, began to show some perplexity.", "He raised one eyebrow slightly and,\n\ntaking advantage of a pause, spoke:\n\n\u2018The foreign artiste is expressing his admiration for Moscow and its\n\ntechnological development, as well as for the Muscovites.\u2019 Here Bengalsky\n\nsmiled twice, first to the stalls, then to the gallery.", "Woland, Fagott and the cat turned their heads in the direction of the\n\nmaster of ceremonies.", "\u2018Did I express admiration?\u2019 the magician asked the checkered Fagott.", "\u2018By no means, Messire, you never expressed any admiration,\u2019 came the\n\nreply.", "\u2018Then what is the man saying?\u2019\n\n\u2018He quite simply lied!\u2019 the checkered assistant declared sonorously, for\n\nthe whole theatre to hear, and turning to Bengalsky, he added: \u2018Congrats,\n\ncitizen, you done lied!\u2019\n\nTittering spattered from the gallery, but Bengalsky gave a start and\n\ngoggled his eyes.", "\u2018Of course, I\u2019m not so much interested in buses, telephones and other...\u2019\n\n\u2018Apparatuses,\u2019 the checkered one prompted.", "\u2018Quite right, thank you,\u2019 the magician spoke slowly in a heavy bass,\n\n\u2018as in a question of much greater importance: have the city folk changed\n\ninwardly?\u2019\n\n\u2018Yes, that is the most important question, sir.\u2019\n\nThere was shrugging and an exchanging of glances in the wings,\n\nBengalsky stood all red, and Rimsky was pale.", "But here, as if sensing the\n\nnascent alarm, the magician said:\n\n\u2018However, we\u2019re talking away, my dear Fagott, and the audience is\n\nbeginning to get bored.", "My gentle Fagott, show us some simple little thing\n\nto start with.\u2019\n\nThe audience stirred.", "Fagott and the cat walked along the footlights to\n\nopposite sides of the stage.", "Fagott snapped his fingers, and with a rollicking\n\nThree, four!\u2018 snatched a deck of cards from the air, shuffled it, and sent it in\n\na long ribbon to the cat.", "The cat intercepted it and sent it back.", "The satiny\n\nsnake whiffled, Fagott opened his mouth like a nestling and swallowed it all\n\ncard by card.", "After which the cat bowed, scraping his right hind paw,\n\nwinning himself unbelievable applause.", "\u2018Class!", "Real class!\u2019 rapturous shouts came from the wings.", "And Fagott jabbed his finger at the stalls and announced:\n\n\u2018You\u2019ll find that same deck, esteemed citizens, on citizen Parchevsky in\n\nthe seventh row, just between a three-rouble bill and a summons to court in\n\nconnection with the payment of alimony to citizen Zelkova.\u2019\n\nThere was a stirring in the stalls, people began to get up, and finally some\n\ncitizen whose name was indeed Parchevsky, all crimson with amazement,\n\nextracted the deck from his wallet and began sticking it up in the air, not\n\nknowing what to do with it.", "\u2018You may keep it as a souvenir!\u2019 cried Fagott.", "\u2018Not for nothing did you\n\nsay at dinner yesterday that if it weren\u2019t for poker your life in Moscow\n\nwould be utterly unbearable.\u2019\n\n\u2018An old trick!\u2019 came from the gallery.", "The one in the stalls is from the\n\nsame company.\u2018\n\n\u2018You think so?\u2019 shouted Fagott, squinting at the gallery.", "\u2018In that case\n\nyou\u2019re also one of us, because the deck is now in your pocket!\u2019\n\nThere was movement in the balcony, and a joyful voice said:\n\n\u2018Right!", "He\u2019s got it!", "Here, here!", "...", "Wait!", "It\u2019s ten-rouble bills!\u2019 Those\n\nsitting in the stalls turned their heads.", "In the gallery a bewildered citizen\n\nfound in his pocket a bank-wrapped packet with \u2018One thousand roubles\u2019\n\nwritten on it.", "His neighbours hovered over him, and he, in amazement,\n\npicked at the wrapper with his fingernail, trying to find out if the bills were\n\nreal or some sort of magic ones.", "\u2018By God, they\u2019re real!", "Ten-rouble bills!\u2019 joyful cries came from the\n\ngallery.", "\u2018I want to play with the same kind of deck,\u2019 a fat man in the middle of\n\nthe stalls requested merrily.", "\u2018Avec playzeer!\u2019 Fagott responded.", "\u2018But why just you?", "Everyone will\n\nwarmly participate!\u2019 And he commanded: \u2018Look up, please!", "...

once to this outrageous\n\nsuggestion.", "Tear his head off?", "There\u2019s an idea!", "Behemoth!\u2018 he shouted to\n\nthe cat.", "\u2019Go to it!", "Ein, zwei, drei!", "!\u2018\n\nAnd an unheard-of thing occurred.", "The fur bristled on the cat\u2019s back, and\n\nhe gave a rending miaow.", "Then he compressed himself into a ball and shot\n\nlike a panther straight at Bengalsky\u2019s chest, and from there on to his head.", "Growling, the cat sank his plump paws into the skimpy chevelure of the\n\nmaster of ceremonies and in two twists tore the head from the thick neck\n\nwith a savage howl.", "The two and a half thousand people in the theatre cried out as one.", "Blood\n\nspurted in fountains from the torn neck arteries and poured over the shirt-\n\nfront and tailcoat.", "The headless body paddled its feet somehow absurdly\n\nand sat down on the floor.", "Hysterical women\u2019s cries came from the\n\naudience.", "The cat handed the head to Fagott, who lifted it up by the hair and\n\nshowed it to the audience, and the head cried desperately for all the theatre\n\nto hear:\n\n\u2018A doctor!\u2019\n\n\u2018Will you pour out such drivel in the future?\u2019 Fagott asked the weeping\n\nhead menacingly.", "\u2018Never again!\u2019 croaked the head.", "\u2018For God\u2019s sake, don\u2019t torture him!\u2019 a woman\u2019s voice from a box seat\n\nsuddenly rose above the clamour, and the magician turned in the direction\n\nof that voice.", "\u2018So, what then, citizens, shall we forgive him?\u2019 Fagott asked, addressing\n\nthe audience.", "\u2018Forgive him, forgive him!\u2019 separate voices, mostly women\u2018s, spoke first,\n\nthen merged into one chorus with the men\u2019s.", "\u2018What are your orders, Messire?\u2019 Fagott asked the masked man.", "\u2018Well, now,\u2019 the latter replied pensively, \u2018they\u2019re people like any other\n\npeople ...", "They love money, but that has always been so ... Mankind loves\n\nmoney, whatever it\u2019s made of \u2014 leather, paper, bronze, gold.", "Well, they\u2019re\n\nlight-minded ... well, what of it ... mercy sometimes knocks at their hearts ...\n\nordinary people ...", "In general, reminiscent of the former ones ... only the\n\nhousing problem has corrupted them...\u2019 And he ordered loudly: Tut the head\n\non.\u2018\n\nThe cat, aiming accurately, planted the head on the neck, and it sat\n\nexactly in its place, as if it had never gone anywhere.", "Above all, there was\n\nnot even any scar left on the neck.", "The cat brushed Bengalsky\u2019s tailcoat and\n\nshirt-front with his paws, and all traces of blood disappeared from them.", "Fagott got the sitting Bengalsky to his feet, stuck a packet of money into his\n\ncoat pocket, and sent him from the stage with the words:\n\n\u2018Buzz off, it\u2019s more fun without you!\u2019\n\nStaggering and looking around senselessly, the master of ceremonies had\n\nplodded no farther than the fire post when he felt sick.", "He cried out\n\npitifully:\n\n\u2018My head, my head!", "...\u2019\n\nAmong those who rushed to him was Rimsky.", "The master of ceremonies\n\nwept, snatched at something in the air with his hands, and muttered:\n\n\u2018Give me my head, give me back my head ... Take my apartment, take\n\nmy paintings, only give me back my head!", "...\u2019\n\nA messenger ran for a doctor.", "They tried to lie Bengalsky down on a sofa\n\nin the dressing room, but he began to struggle, became violent.", "They had to\n\ncall an ambulance.", "When the unfortunate master of ceremonies was taken\n\naway, Rimsky ran back to the stage and saw that new wonders were taking\n\nplace on it.", "Ah, yes, incidentally, either then or a little earlier, the magician\n\ndisappeared from the stage together with his faded armchair, and it must be\n\nsaid that the public took absolutely no notice of it, carried away as it was by\n\nthe extraordinary things Fagott was unfolding on stage.", "And Fagott, having packed off the punished master of ceremonies,\n\naddressed the public thus:\n\n\u2018All righty, now that we\u2019ve kicked that nuisance out, let\u2019s open a ladies\u2019\n\nshop!\u2019\n\nAnd all at once the floor of the stage was covered with Persian carpets,\n\nhuge mirrors appeared, lit by greenish tubes at the sides, and between the\n\nmirrors \u2014 display windows, and in them the merrily astonished spectators\n\nsaw Parisian ladies\u2019 dresses of various colours and cuts.", "In some of the\n\nwindows, that is, while in others there appeared hundreds of ladies\u2019 hats,\n\nwith feathers and without feathers, and \u2014 with buckles or without -\n\nhundreds of shoes, black, white, yellow, leather, satin, suede, with straps,\n\nwith stones.", "Among the shoes there appeared cases of perfume, mountains\n\nof handbags of antelope hide, suede, silk, and among these, whole heaps of\n\nlittle elongated cases of gold metal such as usually contain lipstick.", "A red-headed girl appeared from devil knows where in a black evening\n\ndress \u2014 a girl nice in all respects, had she not been marred by a queer scar\n\non her neck \u2014 smiling a proprietary smile by the display windows.", "Fagott, grinning sweetly, announced that the firm was offering perfectly\n\ngratis an exchange of the ladies\u2019 old dresses and shoes for Parisian models\n\nand Parisian shoes.", "The same held, he added, for the handbags and other\n\nthings.", "The cat began scraping with his hind paw, while his front paw performed\n\nthe gestures appropriate to a doorman opening a door.", "The girl sang out sweetly, though with some hoarseness, rolling her r\u2018s,\n\nsomething not quite comprehensible but, judging by the women\u2019s faces in\n\nthe stalls, very tempting:\n\n\u2018Gu\u00e9rlain, Chanel, Mitsouko, Narcisse Noir, Chanel No.", "5, evening\n\ngowns, cocktail dresses ...\u2019\n\nFagott wriggled, the cat bowed, the girl opened the glass windows.", "\u2018Welcome!\u2019 yelled Fagott.", "\u2018With no embarrassment or ceremony!\u2019\n\nThe audience was excited, but as yet no one ventured on stage.", "Finally\n\nsome brunette stood up in the tenth row of the stalls and, smiling as if to say\n\nit was all the same to her and she did not give a hoot, went and climbed on\n\nstage by the side stairs.", "\u2018Bravo!\u2019 Fagott shouted.", "\u2018Greetings to the first customer!", "Behemoth, a\n\nchair!", "Let\u2019s start with the shoes, madame.\u2019\n\nThe brunette sat in the chair, and Fagott at once poured a whole heap of\n\nshoes on the rug in front of her.", "The brunette removed her right shoe, tried a\n\nlilac one, stamped on the rug, examined the heel.", "They won\u2019t pinch?\u2018 she asked pensively.", "To this Fagott exclaimed with a hurt air:\n\n\u2018Come, come!\u2019 and the cat miaowed resentfully.", "\u2018I\u2019ll take this pair, m\u2019sieur,\u2018 the brunette said with dignity, putting on the\n\nsecond shoe as well.", "The brunette\u2019s old shoes were tossed behind a curtain, and she proceeded\n\nthere herself, accompanied by the red-headed girl and Fagott, who was\n\ncarrying several fashionable dresses on hangers.", "The cat bustled about,\n\nhelped, and for greater importance hung a measuring tape around his neck.", "A minute later the brunette came from behind the curtain in such a dress\n\nthat the stalls all let out a gasp.", "The brave woman, who had become\n\nastonishingly prettier, stopped at the mirror, moved her bare shoulders,\n\ntouched the hair on her nape and, twisting, tried to peek at her back.", "The firm asks you to accept this as a souvenir,\u2018 said Fagott, and he\n\noffered the brunette an open case with a flacon in it.", "\u2018Merci,\u2019 the brunette said haughtily and went down the steps to the stalls.", "As she walked, the spectators jumped up and touched the case.", "And here there came a clean breakthrough, and from all sides women\n\nmarched on to the stage.", "Amid the general agitation of talk, chuckles and\n\ngasps, a man\u2019s voice was heard: \u2018I won\u2019t allow it!\u2019 and a woman\u2019s: \u2018Despot\n\nand philistine!", "Don\u2019t break my arm!\u2019 Women disappeared behind the\n\ncurtain, leaving their dresses there and coming out in new ones.", "A whole\n\nrow of ladies sat on stools with gilded legs, stamping the carpet\n\nenergetically with newly shod feet.", "Fagott was on his knees, working away\n\nwith a metal shoehorn; the cat, fainting under piles of purses and shoes,\n\nplodded back and forth between the display windows and the stools; the girl\n\nwith the disfigured neck appeared and disappeared, and reached the point\n\nwhere she started rattling away entirely in French, and, surprisingly, the\n\nwomen all understood her from half a word, even those who did not know a\n\nsingle word of French.", "General amazement was aroused by a man edging his way on-stage.", "He\n\nannounced that his wife had the flu, and he therefore asked that something\n\nbe sent to her through him.", "As proof that he was indeed married, the citizen\n\nwas prepared to show his passport.", "The solicitous husband\u2019s announcement\n\nwas met with guffaws.", "Fagott shouted that he believed him like his own\n\nself, even without the passport, and handed the citizen two pairs of silk\n\nstockings, and the cat for his part added a little tube of lipstick.", "Late-coming women tore on to the stage, and off the stage the lucky ones\n\ncame pouring down in ball gowns, pyjamas with dragons, sober formal\n\noutfits, little hats tipped over one eyebrow.", "Then Fagott announced that owing to the lateness of the hour, the shop\n\nwould close in exactly one minute until the next evening, and an\n\nunbelievable scramble arose on-stage.", "Women hastily grabbed shoes\n\nwithout trying them on.", "One burst behind the curtain like a storm, got out of\n\nher dress there, took possession of the first thing that came to hand - a silk\n\ndressing-gown covered with huge bouquets \u2014 and managed to pick up two\n\ncases of perfume besides.", "Exactly a minute later a pistol shot rang out, the mirrors disappeared, the\n\ndisplay windows and stools dropped away, the carpet melted into air, as did\n\nthe curtain.", "Last to disappear was the high mountain of old dresses and\n\nshoes, and the stage was again severe, empty and bare.", "And it was here that a new character mixed into the affair.", "A pleasant,\n\nsonorous, and very insistent baritone came from box no.", "2:\n\n\u2018All the same it is desirable, citizen artiste, that you expose the technique\n\nof your tricks to the spectators without delay, especially the trick with the\n\npaper money.", "It is also desirable that the master of ceremonies return to the\n\nstage.", "The spectators are concerned about his fate.\u2019\n\nThe baritone belonged to none other than that evening\u2019s guest of honour,\n\nArkady Apollonovich Sempleyarov, chairman of the Acoustics Commission\n\nof the Moscow theatres.", "Arkady Apollonovich was in his box with two ladies: the older one\n\ndressed expensively and fashionably, the other one, young and pretty,\n\ndressed in a simpler way.", "The first, as was soon discovered during the\n\ndrawing up of the report, was Arkady Apollonovich\u2019s wife, and the second\n\nwas his distant relation, a promising debutante, who had come from Saratov\n\nand was living in the apartment of Arkady Apollonovich and his wife.", "\u2018Pardone!\u2019 Fagott replied.", "\u2018I\u2019m sorry, there\u2019s nothing here to expose, it\u2019s\n\nall clear.\u2019\n\n\u2018No, excuse me!", "The exposure is absolutely necessary.", "Without it your\n\nbrilliant numbers will leave a painful impression.", "The mass of spectators\n\ndemands an explanation.\u2019\n\nThe mass of spectators,\u2018 the impudent clown interrupted Sempleyarov,\n\n\u2019doesn\u2019t seem to be saying anything.", "But, in consideration of your most\n\nesteemed desire, Arkady Apollonovich, so be it - I will perform an\n\nexposure.", "But, to that end, will you allow me one more tiny number?\u2018\n\n\u2018Why not?\u2019 Arkady Apollonovich replied patronizingly.", "\u2018But there must\n\nbe an exposure.\u2019\n\n\u2018Very well, very well, sir.", "And so, allow me to ask, where were you last\n\nevening, Arkady Apollonovich?\u2019\n\nAt this inappropriate and perhaps even boorish question, Arkady\n\nApollonovich\u2019s countenance changed, and changed quite drastically.", "\u2018Last evening Arkady Apollonovich was at a meeting of the Acoustics\n\nCommission,\u2019 Arkady Apollonovich\u2019s wife declared very haughtily, \u2018but I\n\ndon\u2019t understand what that has got to do with magic.\u2019\n\n\u2018Ouee, madame!\u2019 Fagott agreed.", "\u2018Naturally you don\u2019t understand.", "As for\n\nthe meeting, you are totally deluded.", "After driving off to the said meeting,\n\nwhich incidentally was not even scheduled for last night, Arkady\n\nApollonovich dismissed his chauffeur at the Acoustics Commission\n\nbuilding on Clean Ponds\u2019 (the whole theatre became hushed), \u2019and went by\n\nbus to Yelokhovskaya Street to visit an actress from the regional itinerant\n\ntheatre, Militsa Andreevna Pokobatko, with whom he spent some four\n\nhours.\u2018\n\n\u2018Aie!\u2019 someone cried out painfully in the total silence.", "Arkady Apollonovich\u2019s young relation suddenly broke into a low and\n\nterrible laugh.", "\u2018It\u2019s all clear!\u2019 she exclaimed.", "\u2018And I\u2019ve long suspected it.", "Now I see\n\nwhy that giftless thing got the role of Louisa!\u20191\n\nAnd, swinging suddenly, she struck Arkady Apollonovich on the head\n\nwith her short and fat violet umbrella.", "Meanwhile, the scoundrelly Fagott, alias Koroviev, was shouting:\n\n\u2018Here, honourable citizens, is one case of the exposure Arkady\n\nApollonovich so importunately insisted on!\u2019\n\n\u2018How dare you touch Arkady Apollonovich, you vile creature!\u2019 Arkady\n\nApollonovich\u2019s wife asked threateningly, rising in the box to all her gigantic\n\nheight.", "A second brief wave of satanic laughter seized the young relation.", "\u2018Who else should dare touch him,\u2019 she answered, guffawing, \u2018if not me!\u2019\n\nAnd for the second time there came the dry, crackling sound of the umbrella\n\nbouncing off the head of Arkady Apollonovich.", "\u2018Police!", "Seize her!", "!\u2019 Sempleyarov\u2019s wife shouted in such a terrible voice\n\nthat many hearts went cold.", "And here the cat also leaped out to the footlights and suddenly barked in\n\na human voice for all the theatre to hear:\n\nThe seance is over!", "Maestro!", "Hack out a march!\u2018\n\nThe half-crazed conductor, unaware of what he was doing, waved his\n\nbaton, and the orchestra did not play, or even strike up, or even bang away\n\nat, but precisely, in the cat\u2019s loathsome expression, hacked out some\n\nincredible march of an unheard-of brashness.", "For a moment there was an illusion of having heard once upon a time,\n\nunder southern stars, in a caf\u00e9-chantant, some barely intelligible, half-blind,\n\nbut rollicking words to this march:\n\nHis Excellency reached the stage\n\nOf liking barnyard fowl.", "He took under his patronage\n\nThree young girls and an owl!!!", "Or maybe these were not the words at all, but there were others to the\n\nsame music, extremely indecent ones.", "That is not the important thing, the\n\nimportant thing is that, after all this, something like babel broke loose in the\n\nVariety.", "The police went running to Sempleyarov\u2019s box, people were\n\nclimbing over the barriers, there were bursts of infernal guffawing and\n\nfurious shouts, drowned in the golden clash of the orchestra\u2019s cymbals.", "And one could see that the stage was suddenly empty, and that the\n\nhoodwinker Fagott, as well as the brazen tom-cat Behemoth, had melted\n\ninto air, vanished as the magician had vanished earlier in his armchair with\n\nthe faded upholstery.", "CHAPTER 13\n\nThe Hero Enters\n\nAnd so, the unknown man shook his finger at Ivan and whispered: \u2018Shhh!", "...\u2019\n\nIvan lowered his legs from the bed and peered.", "Cautiously looking into\n\nthe room from the balcony was a clean-shaven, dark-haired man of\n\napproximately thirty-eight, with a sharp nose, anxious eyes, and a wisp of\n\nhair hanging down on his forehead.", "Having listened and made sure that Ivan was alone, the mysterious visitor\n\ntook heart and stepped into the room.", "Here Ivan saw that the man was\n\ndressed as a patient.", "He was wearing long underwear, slippers on his bare\n\nfeet, and a brown dressing-gown thrown over his shoulders.", "The visitor winked at Ivan, hid a bunch of keys in his pocket, inquired in\n\na whisper: \u2018May I sit down?\u2019 \u2014 and receiving an affirmative nod, placed\n\nhimself in an armchair.", "\u2018How did you get here?\u2019 Ivan asked in a whisper, obeying the dry finger\n\nshaken at him.", "\u2018Aren\u2019t the balcony grilles locked?\u2019\n\nThe grilles are locked,\u2018 the guest agreed, \u2019but Praskovya Fyodorovna,\n\nwhile the dearest person, is also, alas, quite absent-minded.", "A month ago I\n\nstole a bunch of keys from her, and so gained the opportunity of getting out\n\non to the common balcony, which runs around the entire floor, and so of\n\noccasionally calling on a neighbour.\u2018\n\n\u2018If you can get out on to the balcony, you can escape.", "Or is it high up?\u2019\n\nIvan was interested.", "\u2018No,\u2019 the guest replied firmly, \u2018I cannot escape from here, not because it\u2019s\n\nhigh up, but because I have nowhere to escape to.\u2019 And he added, after a\n\npause: \u2018So, here we sit.\u2019\n\n\u2018Here we sit,\u2019 Ivan replied, peering into the man\u2019s brown and very\n\nrestless eyes.", "\u2018Yes ...\u2019 here the guest suddenly became alarmed, \u2018but you\u2019re not violent,\n\nI hope?", "Because, you know, I cannot stand noise, turmoil, force, or other\n\nthings like that.", "Especially hateful to me are people\u2019s cries, whether cries of\n\nrage, suffering, or anything else.", "Set me at ease, tell me, you\u2019re not\n\nviolent?\u2019\n\n\u2018Yesterday in a restaurant I socked one type in the mug,\u2019 the transformed\n\npoet courageously confessed.", "\u2018Your grounds?\u2019 the guest asked sternly.", "\u2018No grounds, I must confess,\u2019 Ivan answered, embarrassed.", "\u2018Outrageous,\u2019 the guest denounced Ivan and added: \u2018And besides, what a\n\nway to express yourself: \u201csocked in the mug\u201d ...", "It is not known precisely\n\nwhether a man has a mug or a face.", "And, after all, it may well be a face.", "So,\n\nyou know, using fists ... No, you should give that up, and for good.\u2019\n\nHaving thus reprimanded Ivan, the guest inquired:\n\n\u2018Your profession?\u2019\n\n\u2018Poet,\u2019 Ivan confessed, reluctantly for some reason.", "The visitor became upset.", "\u2018Ah, just my luck!\u2019 he exclaimed, but at once reconsidered, apologized,\n\nand asked: \u2018And what is your name?\u2019\n\n\u2018Homeless.\u2019\n\n\u2018Oh-oh ...\u2019 the guest said, wincing.", "\u2018What, you mean you dislike my poetry?\u2019 Ivan asked with curiosity.", "\u2018I dislike it terribly.\u2019\n\n\u2018And what have you read.\u2019\n\n\u2018I\u2019ve never read any of your poetry!\u2019 the visitor exclaimed nervously.", "Then how can you say that?\u2018\n\n\u2018Well, what of it?\u2019 the guest replied.", "\u2018As if I haven\u2019t read others.", "Or else\n\n... maybe there\u2019s some miracle?", "Very well, I\u2019m ready to take it on faith.", "Is\n\nyour poetry good?", "You tell me yourself.\u2019\n\n\u2018Monstrous!\u2019 Ivan suddenly spoke boldly and frankly.", "\u2018Don\u2019t write any more!\u2019 the visitor asked beseechingly.", "\u2018I promise and I swear!\u2019 Ivan said solemnly.", "The oath was sealed with a handshake, and here soft footsteps and voices\n\nwere heard in the corridor.", "\u2018Shh!\u2019 the guest whispered and, jumping out to the balcony, closed the\n\ngrille behind him.", "Praskovya Fyodorovna peeked in, asked Ivan how he was feeling and\n\nwhether he wished to sleep in the dark or with a light.", "Ivan asked her to\n\nleave the light on, and Praskovya Fyodorovna withdrew, wishing the patient\n\na good night.", "And when everything was quiet, the guest came back again.", "He informed Ivan in a whisper that there was a new arrival in room 119\n\n\u2014 some fat man with a purple physiognomy, who kept muttering\n\nsomething about currency in the ventilation and swearing that unclean\n\npowers were living in their place on Sadovaya.", "\u2018He curses Pushkin up and down and keeps shouting: \u201cKurolesov,\n\nencore, encore!\u201d\u2019 the guest said, twitching nervously.", "Having calmed\n\nhimself, he sat down, said: \u2018Anyway, God help him,\u2019 and continued his\n\nconversation with Ivan: \u2018So, how did you wind up here?\u2019\n\n\u2018On account of Pontius Pilate,\u2019 Ivan replied, casting a glum look at the\n\nfloor.", "\u2018What?", "!\u2019 the guest cried, forgetting all caution, and clapped his hand over\n\nhis own mouth.", "\u2018A staggering coincidence!", "Tell me about it, I beg you, I\n\nbeg you!\u2019\n\nFeeling trust in the unknown man for some reason, Ivan began,\n\nfalteringly and timorously at first, then more boldly, to tell about the\n\nprevious day\u2019s story at the Patriarch\u2019s Ponds.", "Yes, it was a grateful listener\n\nthat Ivan Nikolaevich acquired in the person of the mysterious stealer of\n\nkeys!", "The guest did not take Ivan for a madman, he showed great interest in\n\nwhat he was being told, and, as the story developed, finally became ecstatic.", "Time and again he interrupted Ivan with exclamations:\n\n\u2018Well, well, go on, go on, I beg you!", "Only, in the name of all that\u2019s holy,\n\ndon\u2019t leave anything out!\u2019\n\nIvan left nothing out in any case, it was easier for him to tell it that way,\n\nand he gradually reached the moment when Pontius Pilate, in a white\n\nmantle with blood-red lining, came out to the balcony.", "Then the visitor put his hands together prayerfully and whispered:\n\n\u2018Oh, how I guessed!", "How I guessed it all!\u2019\n\nThe listener accompanied the description of Berlioz\u2019s terrible death with\n\nan enigmatic remark, while his eyes flashed with spite:\n\n\u2018I only regret that it wasn\u2019t the critic Latunsky or the writer Mstislav\n\nLavrovich instead of this Berlioz!\u2019, and he cried out frenziedly but\n\nsoundlessly: \u2018Go on!\u2019\n\nThe cat handing money to the woman conductor amused the guest\n\nexceedingly, and he choked with quiet laughter watching as Ivan, excited by\n\nthe success of his narration, quietly hopped on bent legs, portraying the cat\n\nholding the coin up next to his whiskers.", "\u2018And so,\u2019 Ivan concluded, growing sad and melancholy after telling\n\nabout the events at Griboedov\u2018s, \u2019I wound up here.\u2018\n\nThe guest sympathetically placed a hand on the poor poet\u2019s shoulder and\n\nspoke thus:\n\n\u2018Unlucky poet!", "But you yourself, dear heart, are to blame for it all.", "You\n\noughtn\u2019t to have behaved so casually and even impertinently with him.", "So\n\nyou\u2019ve paid for it.", "And you must still say thank you that you got off\n\ncomparatively cheaply.\u2019\n\n\u2018But who is he, finally?\u2019 Ivan asked, shaking his fists in agitation.", "The guest peered at Ivan and answered with a question:\n\n\u2018You\u2019re not going to get upset?", "We\u2019re all unreliable here ...", "There won\u2019t\n\nbe any calling for the doctor, injections, or other fuss?\u2019\n\n\u2018No, no!\u2019 Ivan exclaimed.", "Tell me, who is he?\u2018\n\n\u2018Very well,\u2019 the visitor replied, and he said weightily and distinctly:\n\n\u2018Yesterday at the Patriarch\u2019s Ponds you met Satan.\u2019\n\nIvan did not get upset, as he had promised, but even so he was greatly\n\nastounded.", "\u2018That can\u2019t be!", "He doesn\u2019t exist!\u2019\n\n\u2018Good heavens!", "Anyone else might say that, but not you.", "You were\n\napparently one of his first victims.", "You\u2019re sitting, as you yourself\n\nunderstand, in a psychiatric clinic, yet you keep saying he doesn\u2019t exist.", "Really, it\u2019s

agitation simply unable to manage\n\nthe sleeve in which his arm was stuck.", "Shouts and roaring guffaws came from yet another place - namely, the\n\nleft entrance \u2014 and turning his head in that direction, Grigory Danilovich\n\nsaw a second lady, in pink underwear.", "She leaped from the street to the\n\nsidewalk, striving to hide in the hallway, but the audience pouring out\n\nblocked the way, and the poor victim of her own flightiness and passion for\n\ndressing up, deceived by vile Fagott\u2019s firm, dreamed of only one thing \u2014\n\nfalling through the earth.", "A policeman made for the unfortunate woman,\n\ndrilling the air with his whistle, and after the policeman hastened some\n\nmerry young men in caps.", "It was they who produced the guffawing and\n\nhooting.", "A skinny, moustachioed cabby flew up to the first undressed woman and\n\ndashingly reined in his bony, broken-down nag.", "The moustached face was\n\ngrinning gleefully.", "Rimsky beat himself on the

himself, and so on.", "Pah, the devil!", "Twice the upset director put his hand on the receiver, and twice he drew it\n\nback.", "And suddenly, in the dead silence of the office, the telephone burst\n\nout ringing by itself right in the findirector\u2019s face, and he gave a start and\n\nwent cold.", "\u2018My nerves are really upset, though!\u2019 he thought, and picked up\n\nthe receiver.", "He recoiled from it instantly and turned whiter than paper.", "A\n\nsoft but at the same time insinuating and lewd female voice whispered into\n\nthe receiver:\n\n\u2018Don\u2019t call anywhere, Rimsky, it\u2019ll be bad ...\u2019\n\nThe receiver straight away went empty.", "With goose-flesh prickling on his\n\nback, the findirector hung up the telephone and for some reason turned to\n\nlook at the window behind him.", "Through the scant and still barely greening\n\nbranches of a maple, he saw the moon racing in a transparent cloud.", "His\n\neyes fixed on the branches for some reason, Rimsky went on gazing at\n\nthem, and the longer he gazed, the more strongly he was gripped by fear.", "With great effort, the findirector finally turned away from the moonlit\n\nwindow and stood up.", "There could no longer be any question of phone\n\ncalls, and now the findirector was thinking of only one thing \u2014 getting out\n\nof the theatre as quickly as possible.", "He listened: the theatre building was silent.", "Rimsky realized that he had\n\nlong been the only one on the whole second floor, and a childish,\n\nirrepressible fear came over him at this thought.", "He could not think without\n\nshuddering of having to walk alone now along the empty corridors and\n\ndown the stairs.", "Feverishly he seized the hypnotist\u2019s banknotes from the\n\ntable, put them in his briefcase, and coughed so as to cheer himself up at\n\nleast a little.", "The cough came out slightly hoarse, weak.", "And here it seemed to him that a whiff of some putrid dankness was\n\ncoming in under the office door.", "Shivers ran down the findirector\u2019s spine.", "And then the clock also rang out unexpectedly and began to strike midnight.", "And even its striking provoked shivers in the findirector.", "But his heart\n\ndefinitively sank when he heard the English key turning quietly in the lock.", "Clutching his briefcase with damp, cold hands, the findirector felt that if\n\nthis scraping in the keyhole were to go on any longer, he would break down\n\nand give a piercing scream.", "Finally the door yielded to someone\u2019s efforts, opened, and Varenukha\n\nnoiselessly entered the office.", "Rimsky simply sank down into the armchair\n\nwhere he stood, because his legs gave way.", "Drawing a deep breath, he\n\nsmiled an ingratiating smile, as it were, and said quietly:\n\n\u2018God, you frightened me ...\u2019\n\nYes, this sudden appearance might have frightened anyone you like, and\n\nyet at the same time it was a great joy: at least one little end peeped out in\n\nthis tangled affair.", "\u2018Well, tell me quickly!", "Well?", "Well?\u2019 Rimsky wheezed, grasping at this\n\nlittle end.", "\u2018What does it all mean?", "!\u2019\n\n\u2018Excuse me, please,\u2019 the entering man replied in a hollow voice, closing\n\nthe door, \u2018I thought you had already left.\u2019\n\nAnd Varenukha, without taking his cap off, walked to the armchair and\n\nsat on the other side of the desk.", "It must be said that Varenukha\u2019s response was marked by a slight oddity\n\nwhich at once needled the findirector, who could compete in sensitivity\n\nwith the seismograph of any of the world\u2019s best stations.", "How could it be?", "Why did Varenukha come to the findirector\u2019s office if he thought he was\n\nnot there?", "He had his own office, first of all.", "And second, whichever\n\nentrance to the building Varenukha had used, he would inevitably have met\n\none of the night-watchmen, to all of whom it had been announced that\n\nGrigory Danilovich was staying late in his office.", "But the findirector did not\n\nspend long pondering this oddity - he had other problems.", "\u2018Why didn\u2019t you call?", "What are all these shenanigans about Yalta?\u2019\n\n\u2018Well, it\u2019s as I was saying,\u2019 the administrator replied, sucking as if he\n\nwere troubled by a bad tooth.", "\u2018He was found in the tavern in Pushkino.\u2019\n\n\u2018In Pushkino?!", "You mean just outside Moscow?!", "What about the\n\ntelegrams from Yalta?", "!\u2019\n\n\u2018The devil they\u2019re from Yalta!", "He got a telegrapher drunk in Pushkino,\n\nand the two of them started acting up, sending telegrams marked \u201cYalta\u201d,\n\namong other things.\u2019\n\n\u2018Aha ... aha ... Well, all right, all right...\u2019 Rimsky did not say but sang out.", "His eyes lit up with a yellow light.", "In his head there formed the festive\n\npicture of Styopa\u2019s shameful dismissal from his job.", "Deliverance !", "The\n\nfindirector\u2019s long-awaited deliverance from this disaster in the person of\n\nLikhodeev!", "And maybe Stepan Bogdanovich would achieve something\n\nworse than dismissal... \u2018The details!\u2019 said Rimsky, banging the paperweight\n\non the desk.", "And Varenukha began giving the details.", "As soon as he arrived where the\n\nfindirector had sent him, he was received at once and given a most attentive\n\nhearing.", "No one, of course, even entertained the thought that Styopa could\n\nbe in Yalta.", "Everyone agreed at once with Varenukha\u2019s suggestion that\n\nLikhodeev was, of course, at the Yalta in Pushkino.", "\u2018Then where is he now?\u2019 the agitated findirector interrupted the\n\nadministrator.", "\u2018Well, where else could he be?\u2019 the administrator replied, grinning\n\ncrookedly.", "\u2018In a sobering-up cell, naturally!\u2019\n\n\u2018Well, well.", "How nice!\u2019\n\nVarenukha went on with his story, and the more he told, the more vividly\n\nthere unfolded before the findirector the long chain of Likhodeev\u2019s boorish\n\nand outrageous acts, and every link in this chain was worse than the one\n\nbefore.", "The drunken dancing in the arms of the telegrapher on the lawn in\n\nfront of the Pushkino telegraph office to the sounds of some itinerant barrel-\n\norgan was worth something!", "The chase after some female citizens shrieking\n\nwith terror!", "The attempt at a fight with the barman in the Yalta itself!", "Scattering green onions all over the floor of the same Yalta.", "Smashing eight\n\nbottles of dry white Ai-Danil.", "Breaking the meter when the taxi-driver\n\nrefused to take Styopa in his cab.", "Threatening to arrest the citizens who\n\nattempted to stop Styopa\u2019s obnoxiousness ...", "In short, black horror!", "Styopa was well known in Moscow theatre circles, and everyone knew\n\nthat the man was no gift.", "But all the same, what the administrator was\n\ntelling about him was too much even for Styopa.", "Yes, too much.", "Even much\n\ntoo much ...\n\nRimsky\u2019s needle-sharp glance pierced the administrator\u2019s face from\n\nacross the desk, and the longer the man spoke, the grimmer those eyes\n\nbecame.", "The more lifelike and colourful the vile details with which the\n\nadministrator furnished his story, the less the findirector believed the\n\nstoryteller.", "And when Varenukha told how Styopa had let himself go so far\n\nas to try to resist those who came to bring him back to Moscow, the\n\nfindirector already knew firmly that everything the administrator who had\n\nreturned at midnight was telling him, everything, was a lie!", "A lie from first\n\nword to last!", "Varenukha never went to Pushkino, and there was no Styopa in Pushkino.", "There was no drunken telegrapher, there was no broken glass in the tavern,\n\nStyopa did not get tied up with ropes ... none of it happened.", "As soon as the findirector became firmly convinced that the administrator\n\nwas lying to him, fear crept over his body, starting from the legs, and twice\n\nagain the findirector fancied that a putrid malarial dankness was wafting\n\nacross the floor.", "Never for a moment taking his eyes off the administrator\n\n\u2014 who squirmed somehow strangely in his armchair, trying not to get out\n\nof the blue shade of the desk lamp, and screening himself with a newspaper\n\nin some remarkable fashion from the bothersome light - the findirector was\n\nthinking of only one thing: what did it all mean?", "Why was he being lied to\n\nso brazenly, in the silent and deserted building, by the administrator who\n\nwas so late in coming back to him?", "And the awareness of danger, an\n\nunknown but menacing danger, began to gnaw at Rimsky\u2019s soul.", "Pretending\n\nto ignore Varenukha\u2019s dodges and tricks with the newspaper, the findirector\n\nstudied his face, now almost without listening to the yarn Varenukha was\n\nspinning.", "There was something that seemed still more inexplicable than the\n\ncalumny invented, God knows why, about adventures in Pushkino, and that\n\nsomething was the change in the administrator\u2019s appearance and manners.", "No matter how the man pulled the duck-like visor of his cap over his\n\neyes, so as to throw a shadow on his face, no matter how he fidgeted with\n\nthe newspaper, the findirector managed to make out an enormous bruise on\n\nthe right side of his face just by the nose.", "Besides that, the normally full-\n\nblooded administrator was now pale with a chalk-like, unhealthy pallor, and\n\non this stifling night his neck was for some reason wrapped in an old striped\n\nscarf.", "Add to that the repulsive manner the administrator had acquired\n\nduring the time of his absence of sucking and smacking, the sharp change in\n\nhis voice, which had become hollow and coarse, and the furtiveness and\n\ncowardliness in his eyes, and one could boldly say that Ivan Savelyevich\n\nVarenukha had become unrecognizable.", "Something else burningly troubled the findirector, but he was unable to\n\ngrasp precisely what it was, however much he strained his feverish mind,\n\nhowever hard he peered at Varenukha.", "One thing he could affirm, that there\n\nwas something unprecedented, unnatural in this combination of the\n\nadministrator and the familiar armchair.", "\u2018Well, we finally overpowered him, loaded him into the car,\u2019 Varenukha\n\nboomed, peeking from behind the paper and covering the bruise with his\n\nhand.", "Rimsky suddenly reached out and, as if mechanically, tapping his fingers\n\non the table at the same time, pushed the electric-bell button with his palm\n\nand went numb.", "The sharp signal ought to have been heard without fail in\n\nthe empty building.", "But no signal came, and the button sank lifelessly into\n\nthe wood of the desk.", "The button was dead, the bell broken.", "The findirector\u2019s stratagem did not escape the notice of Varenukha, who\n\nasked, twitching, with a clearly malicious fire flickering in his eyes:\n\n\u2018What are you ringing for?\u2019\n\n\u2018Mechanically,\u2019 the findirector replied hollowly, jerking his hand back,\n\nand asked in turn, in an unsteady voice: \u2018What\u2019s that on your face?\u2019\n\n\u2018The car skidded, I bumped against the door-handle,\u2019 Varenukha said,\n\nlooking away.", "\u2018He\u2019s lying!\u2019 the findirector exclaimed mentally.", "And here his eyes\n\nsuddenly grew round and utterly insane, and he stared at the back of the\n\narmchair.", "Behind the chair on the floor two shadows lay criss-cross, one more\n\ndense and black, the other faint and grey.", "The shadow of the back of the\n\nchair and of its tapering legs could be seen distinctly on the floor, but there\n\nwas no shadow of Varenukha\u2019s head above the back of the chair, or of the\n\nadministrator\u2019s legs under its legs.", "\u2018He casts no shadow!\u2019 Rimsky cried out desperately in his mind.", "He\n\nbroke into shivers.", "Varenukha, following Rimsky\u2019s insane gaze, looked furtively behind him\n\nat the back of the chair, and realized that he had been found out.", "He got up\n\nfrom the chair (the findirector did likewise) and made one step back from\n\nthe desk, clutching his briefcase in his hands.", "\u2018He\u2019s guessed, damn him!", "Always was clever,\u2019 Varenukha said, grinning\n\nspitefully right in the findirector\u2019s face, and he sprang unexpectedly from\n\nthe chair to the door and quickly pushed down the catch on the lock.", "The\n\nfindirector looked desperately behind him, as he retreated to the window\n\ngiving on to the garden, and in this window, flooded with moonlight, saw\n\nthe face of a naked girl pressed against the glass and her naked arm\n\nreaching through the vent-pane and trying to open the lower latch.", "The\n\nupper one was already open.", "It seemed to Rimsky that the light of the desk lamp was going out and the\n\ndesk was tilting.", "An icy wave engulfed Rimsky, but \u2014 fortunately for him -\n\nhe got control of himself and did not fall.", "He had enough strength left to\n\nwhisper, but not cry out:\n\n\u2018Help ...\u2019\n\nVarenukha, guarding the door, hopped up and down by it, staying in air\n\nfor a long time and swaying there.", "Waving his hooked fingers in Rimsky\u2019s\n\ndirection, he hissed and smacked, winking to the girl in the window.", "She began to hurry, stuck her red-haired head through the vent, reached\n\nher arm down as far as she could, her nails clawing at the lower latch and\n\nshaking the frame.", "Her arm began to lengthen, rubber-like, and became\n\ncovered with a putrid green.", "Finally the dead woman\u2019s green fingers got\n\nhold of the latch knob, turned it, and the frame began to open.", "Rimsky cried\n\nout weakly, leaned against the wall, and held his briefcase in front of him\n\nlike a shield.", "He realized that his end had come.", "The frame swung wide open, but instead of the night\u2019s freshness and the\n\nfragrance of the lindens, the smell of a cellar burst into the room.", "The dead\n\nwoman stepped on to the window-sill.", "Rimsky clearly saw spots of decay\n\non her breast.", "And just then the joyful, unexpected crowing of a cock came from the\n\ngarden, from that low building beyond the shooting gallery where birds\n\nparticipating in the programme were kept.", "A loud, trained cock trumpeted,\n\nannouncing that dawn was rolling towards Moscow from the east.", "Savage fury distorted the girl\u2019s face, she emitted a hoarse oath, and at the\n\ndoor Varenukha shrieked and dropped from the air to the floor.", "The cock-crow was repeated, the girl clacked her teeth, and her red hair\n\nstood on end.", "With the third crowing of the cock, she turned and flew out.", "And after her, jumping up and stretching himself horizontally in the air,\n\nlooking like a flying cupid, Varenukha slowly floated over the desk and out\n\nthe window.", "White as snow, with not a single black hair on his head, the old man who\n\nstill recently had been Rimsky rushed to the door, undid the catch, opened\n\nthe door, and ran hurtling down the dark corridor.", "At the turn to the stairs,\n\nmoaning with fear, he felt for the switch, and the stairway lighted up.", "On\n\nthe stairs the shaking, trembling old man fell because he imagined that\n\nVarenukha had softly tumbled on top of him.", "Having run downstairs, Rimsky saw a watchman asleep on a chair by the\n\nbox office in the lobby.", "Rimsky stole past him on tiptoe and slipped out the\n\nmain entrance.", "Outside he felt slightly better.", "He recovered his senses\n\nenough to realize, clutching his head, that his hat had stayed behind in the\n\noffice.", "Needless to say, he did not go back for it, but, breathless, ran across the\n\nwide street to the opposite comer by the movie theatre, near which a dull\n\nreddish light hovered.", "In a moment he was there.", "No one had time to\n\nintercept the cab.", "\u2018Make the Leningrad express, I\u2019ll tip you well,\u2019 the old man said,\n\nbreathing heavily and clutching his heart.", "\u2018I\u2019m going to the garage,\u2019 the driver answered hatefully and turned away.", "Then Rimsky unlatched his briefcase, took out fifty roubles, and handed\n\nthem to the driver through the open front window.", "A few moments later, the rattling car was flying like the wind down\n\nSadovoye Ring.", "The passenger was tossed about on his seat, and in the\n\nfragment of mirror hanging in front of the driver, Rimsky saw now the\n\ndriver\u2019s happy eyes, now his own insane ones.", "Jumping out of the car in front of the train station, Rimsky cried to the\n\nfirst man he saw in a white apron with a badge:\n\n\u2018First class, single, I\u2019ll pay thirty,\u2019 he was pulling the banknotes from his\n\nbriefcase, crumpling them, \u2018no first class, get me second ... if not - a hard\n\nbench!\u2019\n\nThe man with the badge kept glancing up at the lighted clock face as he\n\ntore the banknotes from Rimsky\u2019s hand.", "Five minutes later the express train disappeared from under the glass\n\nvault of the train station and vanished clean away in the darkness.", "And with\n\nit vanished Rimsky.", "CHAPTER 15\n\nNikanor Ivanovich\u2019s Dream\n\nIt is not difficult to guess that the fat man with the purple physiognomy who\n\nwas put in room 119 of the clinic was Nikanor Ivanovich Bosoy.", "He got to Professor Stravinsky not at once, however, but after first\n\nvisiting another place.", "1 Of this other place little remained in Nikanor\n\nIvanovich\u2019s memory.", "He recalled only a desk, a bookcase and a sofa.", "There a conversation was held with Nikanor Ivanovich, who had some\n\nsort of haze before his eyes from the rush of blood and mental agitation, but\n\nthe conversation came out somehow strange, muddled, or, better to say, did\n\nnot come out at all.", "The very first question put to Nikanor Ivanovich was the following-.", "\u2018Are you Nikanor Ivanovich Bosoy, chairman of the house committee at\n\nno.", "302-bis on Sadovaya Street?\u2019\n\nTo this Nikanor Ivanovich, bursting into terrible laughter, replied literally\n\nthus:\n\n\u2018I\u2019m Nikanor, of course I\u2019m Nikanor!", "But what the deuce kind of\n\nchairman am I?\u2019\n\n\u2018Meaning what?\u2019 the question was asked with a narrowing of eyes.", "\u2018Meaning,\u2019 he replied, \u2018that if I was chairman, I should have determined\n\nat once that he was an unclean power!", "Otherwise \u2014 what is it?", "A cracked\n\npince-nez, all in rags ... what kind of foreigner\u2019s interpreter could he be?\u2019\n\n\u2018Who are you talking about?\u2019 Nikanor Ivanovich was asked.", "\u2018Koroviev!\u2019 Nikanor Ivanovich cried out.", "\u2018Got himself lodged in our\n\napartment number fifty.", "Write it down \u2014 Koroviev!", "He must be caught at\n\nonce.", "Write it down \u2014 the sixth entrance.", "He\u2019s there.\u2019\n\n\u2018Where did you get the currency?\u2019 Nikanor Ivanovich was asked\n\nsoulfully.", "\u2018As God is true, as God is almighty,\u2019 Nikanor Ivanovich began, \u2018he sees\n\neverything, and it serves me right.", "I never laid a finger on it, never even\n\nsuspected what it was, this currency!", "God is punishing me for my iniquity,\u2019\n\nNikanor Ivanovich went on with feeling, now buttoning, now unbuttoning\n\nhis shirt, now crossing himself.", "\u2018I took!", "I took, but I took ours, Soviet\n\nmoney!", "I\u2019d register people for money, I don\u2019t argue, it happened.", "Our\n\nsecretary Bedsornev is a good one, too, another good one!", "Frankly\n\nspeaking, there\u2019s nothing but thieves in the house management ...", "But I\n\nnever took currency!\u2019\n\nTo the request that he stop playing the fool and tell how the dollars got\n\ninto the ventilation, Nikanor Ivanovich went on his knees and swayed,\n\nopening his mouth as if he meant to swallow a section of the parquet.", "\u2018If you want,\u2019 he mumbled, \u2018I\u2019ll eat dirt that I didn\u2019t do it!", "And Koroviev\n\n- he\u2019s the devil!\u2019\n\nAll patience has its limits, and the voice at the desk was now raised,\n\nhinting to Nikanor Ivanovich that it was time he began speaking in human\n\nlanguage.", "Here the room with that same sofa resounded with Nikanor Ivanovich\u2019s\n\nwild roaring, as he jumped up from his knees:\n\n\u2018There he is!", "There, behind the bookcase!", "He\u2019s grinning!", "And his pince-\n\nnez ...", "Hold him!", "Spray the room with holy water!\u2019\n\nThe blood left Nikanor Ivanovich\u2019s face.", "Trembling, he made crosses in\n\nthe air, rushing to the door and back, intoned some prayer, and finally began\n\nspouting sheer gibberish.", "It became perfectly clear that Nikanor Ivanovich was unfit for any\n\nconversation.", "He was taken out and put in a separate room, where he\n\ncalmed down somewhat and only prayed and sobbed.", "They did, of course, go to Sadovaya and visit apartment no.", "50.", "But they\n\ndid not find any Koroviev there, and no one in the house either knew or had\n\nseen any Koroviev.", "The apartment occupied by the late Berlioz, as well as\n\nby the Yalta-visiting Likhodeev, was empty, and in the study wax seals\n\nhung peacefully on the bookcases, unbroken by anyone.", "With that they left\n\nSadovaya, and there also departed with them the perplexed and dispirited\n\nsecretary of the house management, Bedsornev.", "In the evening Nikanor Ivanovich was delivered to Stravinsky\u2019s clinic.", "There he became so agitated that an injection, made according to\n\nStravinsky\u2019s recipe, had to be given him, and only after midnight did\n\nNikanor Ivanovich fall asleep in room 119, every now and then emitting a\n\nheavy, painful moan.", "But the longer he slept, the easier his sleep became.", "He stopped tossing\n\nand groaning, his breathing became easy and regular, and he was left alone.", "Then Nikanor Ivanovich was visited by a dream, at the basis of which\n\nundoubtedly lay the experience of that day.", "It began with Nikanor\n\nIvanovich seeing as it were some people with golden trumpets in their\n\nhands leading him, and very solemnly, to a big lacquered door.", "At this door\n\nhis companions played as it were a flourish for Nikanor Ivanovich, and then\n\nfrom the sky a resounding bass said merrily:\n\n\u2018Welcome, Nikanor Ivanovich, turn over your currency!\u2019\n\nExceedingly astonished, Nikanor Ivanovich saw a black loudspeaker\n\nabove him.", "Then he found himself for some reason in a theatre house, where crystal\n\nchandeliers blazed under a gilded ceiling and Quinquet lamps2 on the walls.", "Everything was as it ought to be in a small-sized but very costly theatre.", "There was a stage closed off by a velvet curtain, its dark cerise background\n\nspangled, as if with stars, with oversized gold pieces, there was a\n\nprompter\u2019s box, and there was even an audience.", "What surprised Nikanor Ivanovich was that this audience was all of the\n\nsame sex - male - and all for some reason bearded.", "Besides that, it was\n\nstriking that there were no seats in the theatre, and the audience was all\n\nsitting on the floor, splendidly polished and slippery.", "Abashed in this new and big company, Nikanor Ivanovich, after a brief\n\nhesitation, followed the general example and sat down on the parquet\n\nTurkish-fashion, huddled between some stalwart, bearded redhead and\n\nanother citizen, pale and quite overgrown.", "None of the sitters paid any\n\nattention to the newly arrived spectator.", "Here the soft ringing of a bell was heard, the lights in the house went out,\n\nand the curtain opened to reveal a lighted stage with an armchair, a little\n\ntable on which stood a golden bell, and a solid black velvet backdrop.", "An artiste came out from the wings in an evening jacket, smoothly\n\nshaven, his hair neatly parted, young and with very pleasant features.", "The\n\naudience in the house livened up, and everyone turned towards the stage.", "The artiste advanced to the prompter\u2019s box and rubbed his hands.", "\u2018All sitting?\u20193 he asked in a soft baritone and smiled to the house.", "\u2018Sitting, sitting,\u2019 a chorus of tenors and basses answered from the house.", "\u2018Hm ...\u2019 the artiste began pensively, \u2018and how you\u2019re not sick of it I just\n\ndon\u2019t understand!", "Everybody else is out walking around now, enjoying the\n\nspring sun and the warmth, and you\u2019re stuck in here on the floor of a stuffy\n\ntheatre!", "Is the programme so interesting?", "Tastes differ, however,\u2019 the artiste\n\nconcluded philosophically.", "Then he changed both the timbre of his voice and its intonation, and\n\nannounced gaily and resoundingly:\n\n\u2018And now for the next number on our programme - Nikanor Ivanovich\n\nBosoy, chairman of a house committee and director of a dietetic kitchen.", "Nikanor Ivanovich, on-stage!\u2019\n\nGeneral applause greeted the artiste.", "The surprised Nikanor Ivanovich\n\ngoggled his eyes, while the master of ceremonies, blocking the glare of the\n\nfootlights with his hand, located him among the sitters and tenderly\n\nbeckoned him on-stage with his finger.", "And Nikanor Ivanovich, without\n\nknowing how, found himself on-stage.", "Beams of coloured light struck his\n\neyes from in front and below, which at once caused the house and the\n\naudience to sink into darkness.", "\u2018Well, Nikanor Ivanovich, set us a good example, sir,\u2019 the young artiste\n\nsaid soulfully, \u2018turn over your currency.\u2019\n\nSilence ensued.", "Nikanor Ivanovich took a deep breath and quietly began\n\nto speak:\n\n\u2018I swear to God that I ...\u2019\n\nBut before he had time to get the words out, the whole house burst into\n\nshouts of indignation.", "Nikanor Ivanovich got confused and fell silent.", "\u2018As far as I understand you,\u2019 said the programme announcer, \u2018you wanted\n\nto swear to God that you haven\u2019t got any currency?\u2019, and he gazed\n\nsympathetically at Nikanor Ivanovich.", "\u2018Exactly right, I haven\u2019t,\u2018 replied Nikanor Ivanovich.", "\u2018Right,\u2019 responded the artiste, \u2018and ... excuse the indiscretion, where did\n\nthe four hundred dollars that were found in the privy of the apartment of\n\nwhich you and your wife are the sole inhabitants come from?\u2019\n\n\u201cMagic!\u2018 someone in the dark house said with obvious irony.", "\u2018Exactly right \u2014 magic,\u2019 Nikanor Ivanovich timidly replied, vaguely\n\naddressing either the artiste or the dark house, and he explained: \u2018Unclean\n\npowers, the checkered interpreter stuck me with them.\u2019\n\nAnd again the house raised an indignant roar.", "When silence came, the\n\nartiste said:\n\n\u2018See what La Fontaine fables I have to listen to!", "Stuck him with four\n\nhundred dollars!", "Now, all of you here are currency dealers, so I address you\n\nas experts: is that conceivable?\u2019\n\n\u2018We\u2019re not currency dealers,\u2019 various offended voices came from the\n\ntheatre, \u2018but, no, it\u2019s not conceivable!\u2019\n\n\u2018I\u2019m entirely of the same mind,\u2019 the artiste said firmly, \u2018and let me ask\n\nyou: what is it that one can be stuck with?\u2019\n\n\u2018A baby!\u2019 someone cried from the house.", "\u2018Absolutely correct,\u2019 the programme announcer confirmed, \u2018a baby, an\n\nanonymous letter, a tract, an infernal machine, anything else, but no one\n\nwill stick you with four hundred dollars, for such idiots don\u2019t exist in\n\nnature.\u2019 And turning to Nikanor Ivanovich, the artiste added reproachfully\n\nand sorrowfully: \u2018You\u2019ve upset me, Nikanor Ivanovich, and I was counting\n\non you.", "So, our number didn\u2019t come off.\u2019\n\nWhistles came from the house, addressed to Nikanor Ivanovich.", "\u2018He\u2019s a currency dealer,\u2019 they shouted from the house, \u2018and we innocent\n\nones have to suffer for the likes of him!\u2019\n\n\u2018Don\u2019t scold him,\u2019 the master of ceremonies said softly, \u2018he\u2019ll repent.\u2019\n\nAnd turning to Nikanor Ivanovich, his blue eyes filled with tears, he added:\n\n\u2018Well, Nikanor Ivanovich, you may go to your place.\u2019\n\nAfter that the artiste rang the bell and announced loudly:\n\n\u2018Intermission, you blackguards!\u2019\n\nThe shaken Nikanor Ivanovich, who unexpectedly for himself had\n\nbecome a participant in some sort of theatre programme, again found\n\nhimself in his place on the floor.", "Here he dreamed that the house was\n\nplunged in total darkness, and fiery red words leaped out on the walls:\n\n\u2018Turn over your currency!\u2019 Then the curtain opened again and the master of\n\nceremonies invited:\n\n\u2018I call Sergei Gerardovich Dunchil to the stage.\u2019\n\nDunchil turned out to be a fine-looking but rather unkempt man of about\n\nfifty.", "\u2018Sergei Gerardovich,\u2019 the master of ceremonies addressed him, \u2018you\u2019ve\n\nbeen sitting here for a month and a half now, stubbornly refusing to turn\n\nover the currency you still have, while the country is in need of it, and you\n\nhave no use for it whatsoever.", "And still you persist.", "You\u2019re an intelligent\n\nman, you understand it all perfectly well, and yet you don\u2019t want to comply\n\nwith me.\u2019\n\n\u2018To my regret, there is nothing I can do, since I have no more currency,\u2019\n\nDunchil calmly replied.", "\u2018Don\u2019t you at least have some diamonds?\u2019 asked the artiste.", "\u2018No diamonds either.\u2019\n\nThe artiste hung his head and pondered, then clapped his hands.", "A\n\nmiddle-aged lady came out from the wings, fashionably dressed - that is, in\n\na collarless coat and a tiny hat.", "The lady looked worried, but Dunchil\n\nglanced at her without moving an eyebrow.", "\u2018Who is this lady?\u2019 the programme announcer asked Dunchil.", "That is my wife,\u2018 Dunchil replied with dignity and looked at the lady\u2019s\n\nlong neck with a certain repugnance.", "\u2018We have troubled you, Madame Dunchil,\u2019 the master of ceremonies\n\nadverted to the lady, \u2018with regard to the following: we wanted to ask you,\n\ndoes your husband have any more currency?\u2019\n\n\u2018He turned it all over the other time,\u2019 Madame Dunchil replied nervously.", "\u2018Right,\u2019 said the artiste, \u2018well, then, if it\u2019s so, it\u2019s so.", "If he turned it all\n\nover, then we ought to part with Sergei Gerardovich immediately, there\u2019s\n\nnothing else to do!", "If you wish, Sergei Gerardovich, you may leave the\n\ntheatre.\u2019 And the artiste made a regal gesture.", "Dunchil turned calmly and with dignity, and headed for the wings.", "\u2018Just a moment!\u2019 the master of ceremonies stopped him.", "\u2018Allow me on\n\nparting to show you one more number from our programme.\u2019 And again he\n\nclapped his hands.", "The black backdrop parted, and on to the stage came a young beauty in a\n\nball gown, holding in her hands a golden tray on which lay a fat wad tied\n\nwith candy-box ribbon and a diamond necklace from which blue, yellow\n\nand red fire leaped in all directions.", "Dunchil took a step back and his face went pale.", "The house froze.", "\u2018Eighteen thousand dollars and a necklace worth forty thousand in gold,\u2019\n\nthe artiste solemnly announced, \u2018kept by Sergei Gerardovich in the city of\n\nKharkov, in the apartment of his mistress, Ida Herkulanovna Vors, whom\n\nwe have the pleasure of seeing here before us and who so kindly helped in\n\ndiscovering these treasures \u2014 priceless, yet useless in the hands of a private\n\nperson.", "Many thanks, Ida Herkulanovna!\u2019\n\nThe beauty smiled, flashing her teeth, and her lush eyelashes fluttered.", "\u2018And under your so very dignified mask,\u2019 the artiste adverted to Dunchil,\n\n\u2018is concealed a greedy spider and an astonishing bamboozler and liar.", "You\n\nwore everyone out during this month and a half with your dull obstinacy.", "Go home now, and let the hell your wife sets up for you be your\n\npunishment.\u2019\n\nDunchil swayed and, it seems, wanted to fall down, but was held up by\n\nsomeone\u2019s sympathetic hands.", "Here the front curtain dropped and concealed\n\nall those on-stage.", "Furious applause shook the house, so much so that Nikanor Ivanovich\n\nfancied the lights were leaping in the chandeliers.", "When the front curtain\n\nwent up, there was no one on-stage except the lone artiste.", "Greeted with a\n\nsecond burst of applause, he bowed and began to speak:\n\n\u2018In the person of this Dunchil, our programme has shown you a typical\n\nass.", "I did have the pleasure of saying yesterday that the concealing of\n\ncurrency is senseless.", "No one can make use of it under any circumstances, I\n\nassure you.", "Let\u2019s take this same Dunchil.", "He gets a splendid salary and\n\ndoesn\u2019t want for anything.", "He has a splendid apartment, a wife and a\n\nbeautiful mistress.", "But no, instead of living quietly and peacefully without\n\nany troubles, having turned over the currency and stones, this mercenary\n\nblockhead gets himself exposed in front of everybody, and to top it off\n\ncontracts major family trouble.", "So, who\u2019s going to turn over?", "Any\n\nvolunteers?", "In that case, for the next number on our programme, a famous\n\ndramatic talent, the actor Kurolesov, Savva Potapovich, especially invited\n\nhere, will perform excerpts from The Covetous Knight4 by the poet\n\nPushkin.\u2019\n\nThe promised Kurolesov was not slow in coming on stage and turned out\n\nto be a strapping and beefy man, clean-shaven, in a tailcoat and white tie.", "Without any preliminaries, he concocted a gloomy face, knitted his brows,\n\nand began speaking in an unnatural voice, glancing sidelong at the golden\n\nbell:\n\n\u2018As a young scapegrace awaits a tryst with some sly strumpet ...\u20195\n\nAnd Kurolesov told many bad things about himself.", "Nikanor Ivanovich\n\nheard Kurolesov confess that some wretched widow had gone on her knees\n\nto him, howling, in the rain, but had failed to move the actor\u2019s callous heart.", "Before his dream, Nikanor Ivanovich had been completely ignorant of\n\nthe poet Pushkin\u2019s works, but the man himself he knew perfectly well and\n\nseveral times a day used to say phrases like: \u2018And who\u2019s going to pay the\n\nrent \u2014 Pushkin?\u20196 or Then who did unscrew the bulb on the stairway \u2014\n\nPushkin?\u2018 or \u2019So who\u2019s going to buy the fuel \u2014 Pushkin?\u2018\n\nNow, having become acquainted with one of his works, Nikanor\n\nIvanovich felt sad, imagined the woman on her knees, with her orphaned\n\nchildren, in the rain, and involuntarily thought: \u2018What a type, though, this\n\nKurolesov!\u2019\n\nAnd the latter, ever raising his voice, went on with his confession and got\n\nNikanor Ivanovich definitively muddled, because he suddenly started\n\naddressing someone who was not on-stage, and responded for this absent\n\none himself, calling himself now dear sir, now baron, now father, now son,\n\nnow formally, and now familiarly.", "Nikanor Ivanovich understood only one thing, that the actor died an evil\n\ndeath, crying out: \u2018Keys!", "My keys!\u2019, after which he collapsed on the floor,\n\ngasping and carefully tearing off his tie.", "Having died, Kurolesov got up, brushed the dust from his trousers,\n\nbowed with a false smile, and withdrew to the accompaniment of thin\n\napplause.", "And the master of ceremonies began speaking thus:\n\n\u2018We have just heard The Covetous Knight wonderfully performed by\n\nSavva Potapovich.", "This knight hoped that frolicking nymphs would come\n\nrunning to him, and that many other pleasant things in the same vein would\n\noccur.", "But, as you see, none of it happened, no nymphs came running to\n\nhim, and the muses paid him no tribute, and he raised no mansions, but, on\n\nthe contrary, ended quite badly, died of a stroke, devil take him, on his chest\n\nof currency and jewels.", "I warn you that the same sort of thing, if not worse,\n\nis going to happen to you if you don\u2019t turn over your currency!\u2019\n\nWhether Pushkin\u2019s poetry produced such an effect, or it was the prosaic\n\nspeech of the master of ceremonies, in any case a shy voice suddenly came\n\nfrom the house:\n\n\u2018I\u2019ll turn over my currency.\u2019\n\n\u2018Kindly come to the stage,\u2019 the master of ceremonies courteously invited,\n\npeering into the dark house.", "On-stage appeared a short, fair-haired citizen, who, judging by his face,\n\nhad not shaved in about three weeks.", "\u2018Beg pardon, what is your name?\u2019 the master of ceremonies inquired.", "\u2018Kanavkin, Nikolai,\u2019 the man responded shyly.", "\u2018Ah!", "Very pleased, Citizen Kanavkin.", "And so?", "...\u2019\n\n\u2018I\u2019ll turn it over,\u2019 Kanavkin said quietly.", "\u2018How much?\u2019\n\n\u2018A thousand dollars and twenty ten-rouble gold pieces.\u2019\n\n\u2018Bravo!", "That\u2019s all, then?\u2019\n\nThe programme announcer stared straight into Kanavkin\u2019s eyes, and it\n\neven seemed to Nikanor Ivanovich that those eyes sent out rays that\n\npenetrated Kanavkin like X-rays.", "The house stopped breathing.", "\u2018I believe you!\u2019 the artiste exclaimed finally and extinguished his gaze.", "\u2018I\n\ndo!", "These eyes are not lying!", "How many times have I told you that your\n\nbasic error consists in underestimating the significance of the human eye.", "Understand that the tongue can conceal the truth, but the eyes - never!", "A\n\nsudden question is put to you, you don\u2019t even flinch, in one second you get\n\nhold of yourself and know what you must say to conceal the truth, and you\n\nspeak quite convincingly, and not a wrinkle on your face moves, but \u2014 alas\n\n- the truth which the question stirs up from the bottom of your soul leaps\n\nmomentarily into your eyes, and it\u2019s all over!", "They see it, and you\u2019re\n\ncaught!\u2019\n\nHaving delivered, and with great ardour, this highly convincing speech,\n\nthe artiste tenderly inquired of Kanavkin:\n\n\u2018And where is it hidden?\u2019\n\n\u2018With my aunt, Porokhovnikova, on Prechistenka.\u2019\n\n\u2018Ah!", "That\u2019s ... wait ... that\u2019s Klavdia Ilyinishna, isn\u2019t it?\u2019\n\n\u2018Yes.\u2019\n\n\u2018Ah, yes, yes, yes, yes!", "A separate little house?", "A little front garden\n\nopposite?", "Of course, I know, I know!", "And where did you put it there?\u2019\n\n\u2018In the cellar, in a candy tin ...\u2019\n\nThe artiste clasped his hands.", "\u2018Have you ever seen the like?\u2019 he cried out, chagrined.", "\u2018Why, it\u2019ll get\n\ndamp and mouldy there!", "Is it conceivable to entrust currency to such\n\npeople?", "Eh?", "Sheer childishness!", "By God!", "...\u2019\n\nKanavkin himself realized he had fouled up and was in for it, and he\n\nhung his tufty head.", "\u2018Money,\u2019 the artiste went on, \u2018must be kept in the state bank, in special\n\ndry and well-guarded rooms, and by no means in some aunt\u2019s cellar, where\n\nit may, in particular, suffer damage from rats!", "Really, Kanavkin, for shame!", "You\u2019re a grown-up!\u2019\n\nKanavkin no longer knew what to do with himself, and merely picked at\n\nthe lapel of his jacket with his finger.", "\u2018Well, all right,\u2019 the artiste relented, \u2018let bygones be ...\u2019 And he suddenly\n\nadded unexpectedly: \u2018Ah, by the way ... so that in one ... to save a trip ...\n\nthis same aunt also has some, eh?\u2019\n\nKanavkin, never expecting such a turn of affairs, wavered, and the theatre\n\nfell silent.", "\u2018Ehh, Kanavkin ...\u2019 the master of ceremonies said in tender reproach,\n\n\u2018and here I was praising him!", "Look, he just went and messed it up for no\n\nreason at all!", "It\u2019s absurd, Kanavkin!", "Wasn\u2019t I just talking about eyes?", "Can\u2019t\n\nwe see that the aunt has got some?", "Well, then why do you torment us for\n\nnothing?\u2019\n\n\u2018She has!\u2019 Kanavkin cried dashingly.", "\u2018Bravo!\u2019 cried the master of ceremonies.", "Bravo!\u2018 the house roared frightfully.", "When things quieted down, the master of ceremonies congratulated\n\nKanavkin, shook his hand, offered him a ride home to the city in a car, and\n\ntold someone in the wings to go in that same car to fetch the aunt and ask\n\nher kindly to come for the programme at the women\u2019s theatre.", "\u2018Ah, yes, I wanted to ask you, has the aunt ever mentioned where she\n\nhides hers?\u2019 the master of ceremonies inquired, courteously offering\n\nKanavkin a cigarette and a lighted match.", "As he lit up, the man grinned\n\nsomehow wistfully.", "\u2018I believe you, I believe you,\u2019 the artiste responded with a sigh.", "\u2018Not just\n\nher nephew, the old pinchfist wouldn\u2019t tell the devil himself!", "Well, so, we\u2019ll\n\ntry to awaken some human feelings in her.", "Maybe not all the strings have\n\nrotted in her usurious little soul.", "Bye-bye, Kanavkin!\u2019\n\nAnd the happy Kanavkin drove off.", "The artiste inquired whether there\n\nwere any others who wished to turn over their currency, but was answered\n\nwith silence.", "\u2018Odd birds, by God!\u2019 the artiste said, shrugging, and the curtain hid him.", "The lights went out, there was darkness for a while, and in it a nervous\n\ntenor was heard singing from far away:\n\n\u2018There great heaps of gold do shine, and all those heaps of gold are Mine\n\n...\u20197\n\nThen twice the sound of subdued applause came from somewhere.", "\u2018Some little lady in the women\u2019s theatre is turning hers over,\u2019 Nikanor\n\nIvanovich\u2019s red-bearded neighbour spoke up unexpectedly, and added with\n\na sigh: \u2018Ah, if it wasn\u2019t for my geese!", "... I\u2019ve got fighting geese in\n\nLianozovo, my dear fellow ... they\u2019ll die without me, I\u2019m afraid.", "A fighting\n\nbird\u2019s delicate, it needs care ... Ah, if it wasn\u2019t for my geese!", "...", "They won\u2019t\n\nsurprise me with Pushkin ...\u2019 And again he began to sigh.", "Here the house lit up brightly, and Nikanor Ivanovich dreamed that cooks\n\nin white chef\u2019s hats and with ladles in their hands came pouring from all the\n\ndoors.", "Scullions dragged in a cauldron of soup and a stand with cut-up rye\n\nbread.", "The spectators livened up.", "The jolly cooks shuttled among the theatre\n\nbuffs, ladled out bowls of soup, and distributed bread.", "\u2018Dig in, lads,\u2019 the cooks shouted, \u2018and turn over your currency!", "What\u2019s\n\nthe point of sitting here?", "Who wants to slop up this swill!", "Go home, have a\n\ngood drink, a little bite, that\u2019s the way!\u2019\n\n\u2018Now, you, for instance, what\u2019re you doing sitting here, old man?\u2019\n\nNikanor Ivanovich was directly addressed by a fat cook with a raspberry-\n\ncoloured neck, as he offered him a bowl in which a lone cabbage leaf\n\nfloated in some liquid.", "\u2018I don\u2019t have any!", "I don\u2019t!", "I don\u2018t!\u2019 Nikanor Ivanovich cried out in a\n\nterrible voice.", "\u2018You understand, I don\u2019t!\u2018\n\n\u2018You don\u2019t?\u2019 the cook bellowed in a menacing bass.", "\u2018You don\u2019t?\u2019 he\n\nasked in a tender woman\u2019s voice.", "\u2018You don\u2019t, you don\u2018t,\u2019 he murmured\n\nsoothingly, turning into the nurse Praskovya Fyodorovna.", "She was gently shaking Nikanor Ivanovich by the shoulder as he moaned\n\nin his sleep.", "Then the cooks melted away, and the theatre with its curtain\n\nbroke up.", "Through his tears, Nikanor Ivanovich made out his room in the\n\nhospital and two people in white coats, who were by no means casual cooks\n\ngetting at people with their advice, but the doctor and that same Praskovya\n\nFyodorovna, who was holding not a bowl but a little dish covered with\n\ngauze, with a syringe lying on it.", "\u2018What is all this?\u2019 Nikanor Ivanovich said bitterly, as they were giving\n\nhim the injection.", "\u2018I don\u2019t have any and that\u2019s that!", "Let Pushkin turn over\n\nhis currency for them.", "I don\u2019t have any!\u2019\n\n\u2018No, you don\u2019t, you don\u2018t,\u2019 the kind-hearted Praskovya Fyodorovna\n\nsoothed him, \u2018and if you don\u2019t, there\u2019s no more to be said.\u2018\n\nAfter the injection, Nikanor Ivanovich felt better and fell asleep without\n\nany dreams.", "But, thanks to his cries, alarm was communicated to room 120, where the\n\npatient woke up and began looking for his head, and to room 118, where the\n\nunknown master became restless and wrung his hands in anguish, looking\n\nat the moon, remembering the last bitter autumn night of his life, a strip of\n\nlight under the basement door, and uncurled hair.", "From room 118, the alarm flew by way of the balcony to Ivan, and he\n\nwoke up and began to weep.", "But the doctor quickly calmed all these anxious, sorrowing heads, and\n\nthey began to fall asleep.", "Ivan was the last to become oblivious, as dawn\n\nwas already breaking over the river.", "After the medicine, which suffused his\n\nwhole body, calm came like a wave and covered him.", "His body grew\n\nlighter, his head basked in the warm wind of reverie.", "He fell asleep, and the\n\nlast waking thing he heard was the pre-dawn chirping of birds in the woods.", "But they soon fell silent, and he began dreaming that the sun was already\n\ngoing down over Bald Mountain, and the mountain was cordoned off by a\n\ndouble cordon ...\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 16\n\nThe Execution\n\nThe sun was already going down over Bald Mountain, and the mountain\n\nwas cordoned off by a double cordon.", "The cavalry ala that had cut across the procurator\u2019s path around noon\n\ncame trotting up to the Hebron gate of the city.", "Its way had already been\n\nprepared.", "The infantry of the Cappadocian cohort had pushed the\n\nconglomeration of people, mules and camels to the sides, and the ala,\n\ntrotting and raising white columns of dust in the sky, came to an\n\nintersection where two roads met: the south road leading to Bethlehem, and\n\nthe north-west road to Jaffa.", "The ala raced down the north-west road.", "The\n\nsame Cappadocians were strung out along the sides of the road, and in good\n\ntime had driven to the sides of it all the caravans hastening to the feast in\n\nYershalaim.", "Crowds of pilgrims stood behind the Cappadocians, having\n\nabandoned their temporary striped tents, pitched right on the grass.", "Going\n\non for about a half-mile, the ala caught up with the second cohort of the\n\nLightning legion and, having covered another half-mile, was the first to\n\nreach the foot of Bald Mountain.", "Here they dismounted.", "The commander\n\nbroke the ala up into squads, and they cordoned off the whole foot of the\n\nsmall hill, leaving open only the way up from the Jaffa road.", "After some time, the ala was joined at the hill by the second cohort,\n\nwhich climbed one level higher and also encircled the hill in a wreath.", "Finally the century under the command of Mark Ratslayer arrived.", "It\n\nwent stretched out in files along the sides of the road, and between these\n\nfiles, convoyed by the secret guard, the three condemned men rode in a cart,\n\nwhite boards hanging around their necks with \u2018robber and rebel\u2019 written on\n\neach of them in two languages \u2014 Aramaic and Greek.", "The cart with the condemned men was followed by others laden with\n\nfreshly hewn posts with crosspieces, ropes, shovels, buckets and axes.", "Six\n\nexecutioners rode in these carts.", "They were followed on horseback by the\n\ncenturion Mark, the chief of the temple guard of Yershalaim, and that same\n\nhooded man with whom Pilate had had a momentary meeting in a darkened\n\nroom of the palace.", "A file of soldiers brought up the rear of the procession, and behind it\n\nwalked about two thousand of the curious, undaunted by the infernal heat\n\nand wishing to be present at the interesting spectacle.", "The curious from the\n\ncity were now joined by the curious from among the pilgrims, who were\n\nadmitted without hindrance to the tail of the procession.", "Under the shrill\n\ncries of the heralds who accompanied the column and cried aloud what\n\nPilate had cried out at around noon, the procession drew itself up Bald\n\nMountain.", "The ala admitted everyone to the second level, but the second century let\n\nonly those connected with the execution go further up, and then,\n\nmanoeuvring quickly, spread the crowd around the entire hill, so that people\n\nfound themselves between the cordons of infantry above and cavalry below.", "Now they could watch the execution through the sparse line of the infantry.", "And so, more than three hours had gone by since the procession climbed\n\nthe mountain, and the sun was already going down over Bald Mountain, but\n\nthe heat was still unbearable, and the soldiers in both cordons suffered from\n\nit, grew weary with boredom, and cursed the three robbers in their hearts,\n\nsincerely wishing them the speediest death.", "The little commander of the ala, his brow moist and the back of his white\n\nshirt dark with sweat, having placed himself at the foot of the hill by the\n\nopen passage, went over to the leather bucket of the first squad every now\n\nand then, scooped handfuls of water from it, drank and wetted his turban.", "Somewhat relieved by that, he would step away and again begin pacing\n\nback and forth on the dusty road leading to the top.", "His long sword slapped\n\nagainst his laced leather boot.", "The commander wished to give his\n\ncavalrymen an example of endurance, but, pitying his soldiers, he allowed\n\nthem to stick their spears pyramid-like in the ground and throw their white\n\ncloaks over them.", "Under these tents, the Syrians hid from the merciless sun.", "The buckets were quickly emptied, and cavalrymen from different squads\n\ntook turns going to fetch water in the gully below the hill, where in the thin\n\nshade of spindly mulberries a muddy brook was living out its last days in\n\nthe devilish heat.", "There, too, catching the unsteady shade, stood the bored\n\nhorse-handlers, holding the quieted horses.", "The weariness of the soldiers and the abuse they aimed at the robbers\n\nwere understandable.", "The procurator\u2019s apprehensions concerning the\n\ndisorders that might occur at the time of the execution in the city of\n\nYershalaim, so hated by him, fortunately were not borne out.", "And when the\n\nfourth hour of the execution came, there was, contrary to all expectations,\n\nnot a single person left between the two files, the infantry above and the\n\ncavalry below.", "The sun had scorched the crowd and driven it back to\n\nYershalaim.", "Beyond the file of two Roman centuries there were only two\n\ndogs that belonged to no one knew whom and had for some reason ended\n\nup on the hill.", "But the heat got to them, too, and they lay down with their\n\ntongues hanging out, panting and paying no attention to the green-backed\n\nlizards, the only beings not afraid of the sun, darting among the scorching\n\nstones and some sort of big-thorned plants that crept on the ground.", "No one attempted to rescue the condemned men either in Yershalaim\n\nitself, flooded with troops, or here on the cordoned-off hill, and the crowd\n\nwent back to the city, for indeed there was absolutely nothing interesting in\n\nthis execution, while there in the city preparations were under way for the\n\ngreat feast of Passover, which was to begin that evening.", "The Roman infantry on the second level suffered still more than the\n\ncavalry.", "The only thing the centurion Ratslayer allowed his soldiers was to\n\ntake off their helmets and cover their heads with white headbands dipped in\n\nwater, but he kept them standing, and with their spears in their hands.", "He\n\nhimself, in the same kind of headband, but dry, not wet, walked about not\n\nfar from the group of executioners, without even taking the silver plaques\n\nwith lions\u2019 muzzles off his shirt, or removing his greaves, sword and knife.", "The sun beat straight down on the centurion without doing him any harm,\n\nand the lions\u2019 muzzles were impossible to look at \u2014 the eyes were\n\ndevoured by the dazzling gleam of the silver which was as if boiling in the\n\nsun.", "Ratslayer\u2019s mutilated face expressed neither weariness nor displeasure,\n\nand it seemed that the giant centurion was capable of pacing like that all\n\nday, all night and the next day - in short, for as long as necessary.", "Of pacing\n\nin the same way, holding his hands to the heavy belt with its bronze\n\nplaques, glancing in the same stem way now at the posts with the executed\n\nmen, now at the file of soldiers, kicking aside with the toe of a shaggy boot\n\nin the same indifferent way human bones whitened by time or small flints\n\nthat happened under his feet.", "That man in the hood placed himself not far from the posts on a three-\n\nlegged stool and sat there in complacent motionlessness, though poking the\n\nsand with a twig from time to time out of boredom.", "What has been said about there not being a single person beyond the file\n\nof legionaries is not quite true.", "There was one person, but he simply could\n\nnot be seen by everyone.", "He had placed himself, not on the side where the\n\nway up the mountain was open and from where it would have been most\n\nconvenient to watch the execution, but on the north side, where the slope\n\nwas not gentle and accessible, but uneven, with gaps and clefts, where in a\n\ncrevice, clutching at the heaven-cursed waterless soil, a sickly fig tree was\n\ntrying to live.", "Precisely under it, though it gave no shade, this sole spectator who was\n\nnot a participant in the execution had established himself, and had sat on a\n\nstone from the very beginning, that is, for over three hours now.", "Yes, he had\n\nchosen not the best but the worst position for watching the execution.", "But\n\nstill, even from there the posts could be seen, and there could also be seen,\n\nbeyond the file of soldiers, the two dazzling spots on the centurion\u2019s chest,\n\nand that was apparently quite enough for a man who obviously wished to\n\nremain little noticed and not be bothered by anyone.", "But some four hours ago, at the start of the execution, this man had\n\nbehaved quite differently, and might have been noticed very well, which\n\nwas probably why he had now changed his behaviour and secluded himself.", "It was only when the procession came to the very top, beyond the file,\n\nthat he had first appeared, and as an obvious latecomer at that.", "He was\n\nbreathing hard, and did not walk but ran up the hill, pushing his way, and,\n\nseeing the file close together before him as before everyone else, made a\n\nnaive attempt, pretending he did not understand the angry shouts, to break\n\nthrough the soldiers to the very place of execution, where the condemned\n\nmen were already being taken from the cart.", "For that he received a heavy\n\nblow in the chest with the butt end of a spear, and he leaped back from the\n\nsoldiers, crying out not in pain but in despair.", "At the legionary who had\n\ndealt the blow he cast a dull glance, utterly indifferent to everything, like a\n\nman insensible to physical pain.", "Coughing and breathless, clutching his chest, he ran around the hill,\n\ntrying to find some gap in the file on the north side where he could slip\n\nthrough.", "But it was too late, the ring was closed.", "And the man, his face\n\ndistorted with grief, was forced to renounce his attempts to break through to\n\nthe carts, from which the posts had already been unloaded.", "These attempts\n\nwould have led nowhere, except that he would have been seized, and to be\n\narrested on that day by no means entered his plans.", "And so he went to the side, towards the crevice, where it was quieter and\n\nnobody bothered him.", "Now, sitting on the stone, this black-bearded man, his eyes festering from\n\nthe sun and lack of sleep, was in anguish.", "First he sighed, opening his\n\ntallith, worn out in his wanderings, gone from light-blue to dirty grey, and\n\nbared his chest, which had been hurt by the spear and down which ran dirty\n\nsweat; then, in unendurable pain, he raised his eyes to the sky, following the\n\nthree vultures that had long been floating in great circles on high,\n\nanticipating an imminent feast; then he peered with hopeless eyes into the\n\nyellow earth, and saw on it the half-destroyed skull of a dog and lizards\n\nscurrying around it.", "The man\u2019s sufferings were so great that at times he began talking to\n\nhimself.", "\u2018Oh, fool that I am ...\u2019 he muttered, swaying on the stone in the pain of\n\nhis heart and clawing his swarthy chest with his nails.", "\u2018Fool, senseless\n\nwoman, coward!", "I\u2019m not a man, I\u2019m carrion!\u2019\n\nHe would fall silent, hang his head, then, after drinking some warm water\n\nfrom a wooden flask, he would revive again and clutch now at the knife\n\nhidden on his chest under the tallith, now at the piece of parchment lying\n\nbefore him on the stone next to a stylus and a pot of ink.", "On this parchment some notes had already been scribbled:\n\n\u2018The minutes run on, and I, Matthew Levi, am here on Bald Mountain,\n\nand still no death!\u2019\n\nFurther:\n\n\u2018The sun is sinking, but no death.\u2019\n\nNow Matthew Levi wrote hopelessly with the sharp stylus:\n\n\u2018God!", "Why are you angry with him?", "Send him death.\u2019\n\nHaving written this, he sobbed tearlessly and again wounded his chest\n\nwith his nails.", "The reason for Levi\u2019s despair lay in the terrible misfortune that had\n\nbefallen Yeshua and him and, besides that, in the grave error that he, Levi,\n\nin his own opinion, had committed.", "Two days earlier, Yeshua and Levi had\n\nbeen in Bethphage near Yershalaim, where they had visited a certain\n\ngardener who liked Yeshua\u2019s preaching very much.", "The two visitors had\n\nspent the whole morning working in the garden, helping their host, and\n\nplanned to go to Yershalaim towards evening when it cooled off.", "But\n\nYeshua began to hurry for some reason, said he had urgent business in the\n\ncity, and left alone around noontime.", "Here lay Matthew Levi\u2019s first error.", "Why, why had he let him go alone!", "Nor was Matthew Levi to go to Yershalaim that evening.", "He was struck\n\nby some unexpected and terrible ailment.", "He began to shake, his whole\n\nbody was filled with fire, his teeth chattered, and he kept asking to drink all\n\nthe time.", "He could not go anywhere.", "He collapsed on a horse blanket in the\n\ngardener\u2019s shed and lay there till dawn on Friday, when the illness released\n\nLevi as unexpectedly as it had fallen upon him.", "Though he was still weak\n\nand his legs trembled, he took leave of his host and, oppressed by some\n\nforeboding of disaster, went to Yershalaim.", "There he learned that his\n\nforeboding had not deceived him \u2014 the disaster occurred.", "Levi was in the\n\ncrowd and heard the procurator announce the sentence.", "When the condemned men were led off to the mountain, Matthew Levi\n\nran alongside the file in the crowd of the curious, trying to let Yeshua know\n\nin some inconspicuous way that at least he, Levi, was there with him, that\n\nhe had not abandoned him on his last journey, and that he was praying that\n\ndeath would overtake Yeshua as soon as possible.", "But Yeshua, who was\n\nlooking into the distance towards where he was being taken, of course did\n\nnot see Levi.", "And then, when the procession had gone about a half-mile along the\n\nroad, a simple and ingenious thought dawned on Matthew, who was being\n\njostled by the crowd just next to the file, and in his excitement he at once\n\nshowered himself with curses for not having thought of it earlier.", "The file of\n\nsoldiers was not solid, there were spaces between them.", "Given great\n\ndexterity and a precise calculation, one could bend down, slip between two\n\nlegionaries, make it to the cart and jump into it.", "Then Yeshua would be\n\nsaved from suffering.", "One instant would be enough to stab Yeshua in the back with a knife,\n\ncrying to him: \u2018Yeshua!", "I save you and go with you!", "I, Matthew, your\n\nfaithful and only disciple!\u2019\n\nAnd if God granted him one more free instant, he would also have time\n\nto stab himself and avoid death on a post.", "This last, however, was of little\n\ninterest to Levi, the former tax collector.", "He was indifferent to how he died.", "He wanted one thing, that Yeshua, who had never in his life done the least\n\nevil to anyone, should escape torture.", "The plan was a very good one, but the fact of the matter was that Levi\n\nhad no knife with him.", "Nor did he have a single piece of money.", "Furious with himself, Levi got out of the crowd and ran back to the city.", "A single feverish thought was leaping in his burning head: how to procure a\n\nknife there in the city, in any way possible, and have time to overtake the\n\nprocession.", "He ran up to the city gate, manoeuvring amid the throng of caravans\n\nbeing sucked into the city, and saw to his left the open door of a little shop\n\nwhere bread was sold.", "Breathing hard after running down the scorched\n\nroad, Levi got control of himself, entered the shop very sedately, greeted the\n\nwoman behind the counter, asked her to take the top loaf from the shelf,\n\nwhich for some reason he liked better than the others, and when she turned\n\naround, silently and quickly took from the counter that than which there\n\ncould be nothing better - a long, razor-sharp bread knife \u2014 and at once\n\ndashed out of the shop.", "A few moments later he was again on the Jaffa road.", "But the procession\n\nwas no longer in sight.", "He ran.", "At times he had to drop down right in the\n\ndust and lie motionless to recover his breath.", "And so he would lie there, to\n\nthe astonishment of people riding on mules or walking on foot to\n\nYershalaim.", "He would lie listening to his heart pounding not only in his\n\nchest but in his head and ears.", "Having recovered his breath a little, he would\n\njump up and continue running, but ever slower and slower.", "When he finally\n\ncaught sight of the long procession raising dust in the distance, it was\n\nalready at the foot of the hill.", "\u2018Oh, God !...\u2019 Levi moaned, realizing that he was going to be too late.", "And he was too late.", "When the fourth hour of the execution had gone by, Levi\u2019s torments\n\nreached their highest degree and he fell into a rage.", "Getting up from the\n\nstone, he flung to the ground the stolen knife \u2014 stolen in vain, as he now\n\nthought \u2014 crushed the flask with his foot, depriving himself of water, threw\n\noff his kefia, seized his thin hair, and began cursing himself.", "He cursed himself, calling out meaningless words, growled and spat,\n\nabused his father and mother for bringing a fool into the world.", "Seeing that curses and abuse had no effect and nothing in the sun-\n\nscorched place was changed by them, he clenched his dry fists, raised them,\n\nsquinting, to the sky, to the sun that was sliding ever lower, lengthening the\n\nshadows and going to fall into the Mediterranean, and demanded an\n\nimmediate miracle from God.", "He demanded that God at once send Yeshua\n\ndeath.", "Opening his eyes, he became convinced that everything on the hill was\n\nunchanged, except that the blazing spots on the centurion\u2019s chest had gone\n\nout.", "The sun was sending its rays into the backs of the executed men, who\n\nwere facing Yershalaim.", "Then Levi shouted:\n\n\u2018I curse you, God!\u2019\n\nIn a rasping voice he shouted that he was convinced of God\u2019s injustice\n\nand did not intend to believe in him any longer.", "\u2018You are deaf!\u2019 growled Levi.", "\u2018If you were not deaf, you would have\n\nheard me and killed him straight away!\u2019\n\nShutting his eyes, Levi waited for the fire that would fall from the sky\n\nand strike him instead.", "This did not happen, and Levi, without opening his\n\neyes, went on shouting offensive and sarcastic things at the sky.", "He shouted\n\nabout his total disappointment, about the existence of other gods and\n\nreligions.", "Yes, another god would not have allowed it, he would never have\n\nallowed a man like Yeshua to be burnt by the sun on a post.", "\u2018I was mistaken!\u2019 Levi cried in a completely hoarse voice.", "\u2018You are a god\n\nof evil!", "Or are your eyes completely clouded by smoke from the temple\n\ncensers, and have your ears ceased to hear anything but the trumpeting\n\nnoises of the priests?", "You are not an almighty god!", "You are a black god!", "I\n\ncurse you, god of robbers, their soul and their protector!\u2019\n\nHere something blew into the face of the former tax collector, and\n\nsomething rustled under his feet.", "It blew once more, and then, opening his\n\neyes, Levi saw that, either under the influence of his curses, or owing to\n\nother reasons, everything in the world was changed.", "The sun had\n\ndisappeared before reaching the sea, where it sank every evening.", "Having\n\nswallowed it, a storm cloud was rising menacingly and inexorably against\n\nthe sky in the west.", "Its edges were already seething with white foam, its\n\nblack smoky belly was tinged with yellow.", "The storm cloud was growling,\n\nthreads of fire fell from it now and again.", "Down the Jaffa road, down the\n\nmeagre Hinnom valley, over the tents of the pilgrims, driven by the\n\nsuddenly risen wind, pillars of dust went flying.", "Levi fell silent, trying to grasp whether the storm that was about to cover\n\nYershalaim would bring any change in the fate of the unfortunate Yeshua.", "And straight away, looking at the threads of fire cutting up the cloud, he\n\nbegan to ask that lightning strike Yeshua\u2019s post.", "Repentantly looking into\n\nthe clear sky that had not yet been devoured by the cloud, and where the\n\nvultures were veering on one wing to escape the storm, Levi thought he had\n\nbeen insanely hasty with his curses: now God was not going to listen to\n\nhim.", "Turning his gaze to the foot of the hill, Levi fixed on the place where the\n\nstrung-out cavalry regiment stood, and saw that considerable changes had\n\ntaken place there.", "From above, Levi was able to distinguish very well the\n\nsoldiers bustling about, pulling spears out of the ground, throwing cloaks\n\non, the horse-handlers trotting towards the road leading black horses by\n\ntheir bridles.", "The regiment was moving off, that was clear.", "Spitting and\n\nshielding himself with his hand from the dust blowing in his face, Levi tried\n\nto grasp what it might mean if the cavalry was about to leave.", "He shifted his\n\ngaze further up and made out a little figure in a crimson military chlamys\n\nclimbing towards the place of execution.", "And here a chill came over the\n\nheart of the former tax collector in anticipation of the joyful end.", "The man climbing the mountain in the fifth hour of the robbers\u2019\n\nsufferings was the commander of the cohort, who had come galloping from\n\nYershalaim accompanied by an aide.", "At a gesture from Ratslayer, the file of\n\nsoldiers parted, and the centurion saluted the tribune.", "The latter, taking\n\nRatslayer aside, whispered something to him.", "The centurion saluted him a\n\nsecond time and moved towards the group of executioners, who were sitting\n\non stones at the foot of the posts.", "The tribune meanwhile directed his steps\n\ntowards the one sitting on the three-legged stool, and the seated man\n\npolitely rose to meet the tribune.", "And the tribune said something to him in a\n\nlow voice, and the two went over to the posts.", "They were joined by the head\n\nof the temple guard.", "Ratslayer, casting a squeamish sidelong glance at the dirty rags lying on\n\nthe ground near the posts, rags that had recently been the criminals\u2019\n\nclothing, and which the executioners had rejected, called two of them and\n\nordered:\n\n\u2018Follow me!\u2019\n\nFrom the nearest post came a hoarse, senseless song.", "Gestas, hanging on\n\nit, had lost his mind from the flies and sun towards the end of the third hour,\n\nand was now quietly singing something about grapes, but his head, covered\n\nwith a turban, occasionally swayed all the same, and then the flies rose\n\nsluggishly from his face and settled on it again.", "Dysmas, on the second post, suffered more than the other two because he\n\ndid not lose consciousness, and he swung his head constantly and\n\nrhythmically, right and left, so that his ears struck his shoulders.", "Yeshua was more fortunate than the other two.", "In the very first hour, he\n\nbegan to have blackouts, and then he fell into oblivion, hanging his head in\n\nits unwound turban.", "The flies and horseflies therefore covered him\n\ncompletely, so that his face disappeared under the black swarming mass.", "In\n\nhis groin, and on his belly, and in his armpits, fat horseflies sat sucking at\n\nhis yellow naked body.", "Obeying the gestures of the man in the hood, one of the executioners\n\ntook a spear and another brought a bucket and a sponge to the post.", "The\n\nfirst executioner raised the spear and with it tapped first one, then the other\n\nof Yeshua\u2019s arms, stretched out and bound with ropes to the crossbar of the\n\npost.", "The body, with its protruding ribs, gave a start.", "The executioner\n\npassed the tip of the spear over the belly.", "Then Yeshua raised his head, and\n\nthe flies moved off with a buzz, revealing the face of the hanged man,\n\nswollen with bites, the eyes puffy, an unrecognizable face.", "Ungluing his eyelids, Ha-Nozri looked down.", "His eyes, usually clear,\n\nwere slightly clouded.", "\u2018Ha-Nozri!\u2019 said the executioner.", "Ha-Nozri moved his swollen lips and answered in a hoarse robber\u2019s\n\nvoice:\n\n\u2018What do you want?", "Why have you come to me?\u2019\n\n\u2018Drink!\u2019 said the executioner, and a water-soaked sponge on the tip of a\n\nspear rose to Yeshua\u2019s lips.", "Joy flashed in his eyes, he clung to the sponge\n\nand began greedily imbibing the moisture.", "From the neighbouring post\n\ncame the voice of Dysmas:\n\n\u2018Injustice!", "I\u2019m a robber just like him!\u2019\n\nDysmas strained but was unable to move, his arms being bound to the\n\ncrossbar in three places with loops of rope.", "He drew in his belly, clawed the\n\nends of the crossbar with his nails, kept his head turned towards Yeshua\u2019s\n\npost, malice blazed in the eyes of Dysmas.", "A dusty cloud covered the place, it became much darker.", "When the dust\n\nblew away, the centurion shouted:\n\n\u2018Silence on the second post!\u2019\n\nDysmas fell silent.", "Yeshua tore himself away from the sponge, and trying\n\nto make his voice sound gentle and persuasive, but not succeeding, he\n\nbegged the executioner hoarsely:\n\n\u2018Give him a drink.\u2019\n\nIt was growing ever darker.", "The storm cloud had already poured across\n\nhalf the sky, aiming towards Yershalaim, boiling white clouds raced ahead\n\nof the storm cloud suffused with black moisture and fire.", "There was a flash\n\nand a thunderclap right over the hill.", "The executioner removed the sponge\n\nfrom the spear.", "\u2018Praise the magnanimous hegemon!\u2019 he whispered solemnly, and gently\n\npricked Yeshua in the heart.", "He twitched and whispered:\n\n\u2018Hegemon...\u2019\n\nBlood ran down his belly, his lower jaw twitched convulsively and his\n\nhead dropped.", "At the second thunderclap, the executioner was already giving Dysmas a\n\ndrink, and with the same words:\n\n\u2018Praise the hegemon!\u2019 \u2014 killed him as well.", "Gestas, deprived of reason, cried out fearfully as soon as the executioner\n\ncame near him, but when the sponge touched his lips, he growled\n\nsomething and seized it with his teeth.", "A few seconds later his body, too,\n\nslumped as much as the ropes would allow.", "The man in the hood followed the executioner and the centurion, and\n\nafter him came the head of the temple guard.", "Stopping at the first post, the\n\nman in the hood examined the blood-covered Yeshua attentively, touched\n\nhis foot with his white hand, and said to his companions:\n\n\u2018Dead.\u2019\n\nThe same was repeated at the other two posts.", "After that the tribune motioned to the centurion and, turning, started off\n\nthe hilltop together with the head of the temple guard and the man in the\n\nhood.", "Semi-darkness set in, and lightning furrowed the black sky.", "Fire\n\nsuddenly sprayed out of it, and the centurion\u2019s shout: \u2018Raise the cordon!\u2019,\n\nwas drowned in rumbling.", "The happy soldiers rushed headlong down the\n\nhill, putting on their helmets.", "Darkness covered Yershalaim.", "Torrents of rain poured down suddenly and caught the centuries halfway\n\ndown the hill.", "The deluge fell so terribly that the soldiers were already\n\npursued by raging streams as they ran downhill.", "Soldiers slipped and fell in\n\nthe sodden clay, hurrying to get to the level road, along which - now barely\n\nvisible through the sheet of water \u2014 the thoroughly drenched cavalry was\n\nheading for Yershalaim.", "A few minutes later only one man remained in the\n\nsmoky brew of storm, water and fire on the hill.", "Shaking the not uselessly stolen knife, falling from slippery ledges,\n\nclutching at whatever was there, sometimes crawling on his knees, he\n\nstrained towards the posts.", "He now vanished in total darkness, now was\n\nsuddenly illumined by a tremulous light.", "Having made his way to the posts, already up to his ankles in water, he\n\ntore off his heavy water-soaked tallith, remaining just in his shirt, and clung\n\nto Yeshua\u2019s feet.", "He cut the ropes on his shins, stepped up on the lower\n\ncrossbar, embraced Yeshua and freed his arms from the upper bonds.", "The\n\nnaked, wet body of Yeshua collapsed on Levi and brought him to the\n\nground.", "Levi wanted to heave it on to his shoulders straight away, but some\n\nthought stopped him.", "He left the body with its thrown-back head and\n\noutspread arms on the ground in the water, and ran, his feet slithering apart\n\nin the clayey mire, to the other posts.", "He cut the ropes on them as well, and\n\nthe two bodies collapsed on the ground.", "Several minutes passed, and all that remained on the top of the hill was\n\nthese two bodies and the three empty posts.", "Water beat on the bodies and\n\nrolled them over.", "By that time both Levi and the body of Yeshua were gone from the\n\nhilltop.", "CHAPTER 17\n\nAn Unquiet Day\n\nOn Friday morning, that is, the day after the accursed seance, all the\n\navailable staff of the Variety - the bookkeeper Vassily Stepanovich\n\nLastochkin, two accountants, three typists, both box-office girls, the\n\nmessengers, ushers, cleaning women \u2014 in short, all those available, were\n\nnot at their places doing their jobs, but were all sitting on the window-sills\n\nlooking out on Sadovaya and watching what was going on by the wall of\n\nthe Variety.", "By this wall a queue of many thousands clung in two rows, its\n\ntail reaching to Kudrinskaya Square.", "At the head of the line stood some two\n\ndozen scalpers well known to theatrical Moscow.", "The line behaved with much agitation, attracting the notice of the citizens\n\nstreaming past, and was occupied with the discussion of inflammatory tales\n\nabout yesterday\u2019s unprecedented seance of black magic.", "These same tales\n\ncaused the greatest consternation in the bookkeeper Vassily Stepanovich,\n\nwho had not been present at the previous evening\u2019s performance.", "The\n\nushers told of God knows what, among other things that after the\n\nconclusion of the famous seance, some female citizens went running around\n\nin the street looking quite indecent, and so on in the same vein.", "The modest\n\nand quiet Vassily Stepanovich merely blinked his eyes, listening to the tall\n\ntales of these wonders, and decidedly did not know what to undertake, and\n\nyet something had to be undertaken, and precisely by him, because he now\n\nturned out to be the senior member of the whole Variety team.", "By ten o\u2018clock the line of people desiring tickets had swelled so much\n\nthat rumour of it reached the police, and with astonishing swiftness\n\ndetachments were sent, both on foot and mounted, to bring this line into\n\nsome sort of order.", "However, in itself even an orderly snake a half-mile long\n\npresented a great temptation, and caused utter amazement in the citizens on\n\nSadovaya.", "That was outside, but inside the Variety things were also none too great.", "Early in the morning the telephones began to ring and went on ringing\n\nwithout interruption in Likhodeev\u2019s office, in Rimsky\u2019s office, at the\n\nbookkeeper\u2018s, in the box office, and in Varenukha\u2019s office.", "Vassily\n\nStepanovich at first made some answer, the box-office girl also answered,\n\nthe ushers mumbled something into the telephones, but then they stopped\n\naltogether, because to questions of where Likhodeev, Varenukha and\n\nRimsky were, there was decidedly no answer.", "At first they tried to get off\n\nby saying \u2019Likhodeev\u2019s at home\u2018, but the reply to this was that they had\n\ncalled him at home, and at home they said Likhodeev was at the Variety.", "An agitated lady called, started asking for Rimsky, was advised to call his\n\nwife, to which the receiver, sobbing, answered that she was his wife and\n\nthat Rimsky was nowhere to be found.", "Some sort of nonsense was\n\nbeginning.", "The cleaning woman had already told everybody that when she\n\ncame to the findirector\u2019s office to clean, she saw the door wide open, the\n\nlights on, the window to the garden broken, the armchair lying on the floor,\n\nand no one in the office.", "Shortly after ten o\u2018clock, Madame Rimsky burst into the Variety.", "She was\n\nsobbing and wringing her hands.", "Vassily Stepanovich was utterly at a loss\n\nand did not know how to counsel her.", "Then at half past ten came the police.", "Their first and perfectly reasonable question was:\n\n\u2018What\u2019s going on here, citizens?", "What\u2019s this all about?\u2019\n\nThe team stepped back, bringing forward the pale and agitated Vassily\n\nStepanovich.", "He had to call things by their names and confess that the\n\nadministration of the Variety in the persons of the director, the findirector\n\nand the administrator had vanished and no one knew where, that the master\n\nof ceremonies had been taken to a psychiatric hospital after yesterday\u2019s\n\nseance, and that, to put it briefly, this seance yesterday had frankly been a\n\nscandalous seance.", "The sobbing Madame Rimsky, having been calmed down as much as\n\npossible, was sent home, and the greatest interest was shown in the cleaning\n\nwoman\u2019s story about the shape in which the findirector\u2019s office had been\n\nfound.", "The staff were asked to go to their places and get busy, and in a short\n\nwhile the investigation appeared in the Variety building, accompanied by a\n\nsharp-eared, muscular, ash-coloured dog with extremely intelligent eyes.", "The whisper spread at once among the Variety staff that the dog was none\n\nother than the famous Ace of Diamonds.", "And so it was.", "His behaviour\n\namazed them all.", "The moment Ace of Diamonds ran into the findirector\u2019s\n\noffice, he growled, baring his monstrous yellow fangs, then crouched on his\n\nbelly and, with some sort of look of anguish and at the same time of rage in\n\nhis eyes, crawled towards the broken window.", "Overcoming his fear, he\n\nsuddenly jumped up on the window-sill and, throwing back his sharp\n\nmuzzle, howled savagely and angrily.", "He refused to leave the window,\n\ngrowled and twitched, and kept trying to jump out.", "The dog was taken from the office and turned loose in the lobby, whence\n\nhe walked out through the main entrance to the street and led those\n\nfollowing him to the cab stand.", "There he lost the trail he had been pursuing.", "After that Ace of Diamonds was taken away.", "The investigation settled in Varenukha\u2019s office, where they began\n\nsummoning in turn all the Variety staff members who had witnessed\n\nyesterday\u2019s events during the seance.", "It must be said that the investigation\n\nhad at every step to overcome unforeseen difficulties.", "The thread kept\n\nsnapping off in their hands.", "There had been posters, right?", "Right.", "But during the night they had been\n\npasted over with new ones, and now, strike me dead, there wasn\u2019t a single\n\none to be found!", "And the magician himself, where had he come from?", "Ah,\n\nwho knows!", "But there was a contract drawn up with him?", "\u2018I suppose so,\u2019 the agitated Vassily Stepanovich replied.", "\u2018And if one was drawn up, it had to go through bookkeeping?\u2019\n\n\u2018Most assuredly,\u2019 responded the agitated Vassily Stepanovich.", "\u2018Then where is it?\u2019\n\n\u2018Not here,\u2019 the bookkeeper replied, turning ever more pale and spreading\n\nhis arms.", "And indeed no trace of the contract was found in the files of the\n\nbookkeeping office, nor at the findirector\u2018s, nor at Likhodeev\u2019s or\n\nVarenukha\u2019s.", "And what was this magician\u2019s name?", "Vassily Stepanovich did not know,\n\nhe had not been at the seance yesterday.", "The ushers did not know, the box-\n\noffice girl wrinkled her brow, wrinkled it, thought and thought, and finally\n\nsaid:\n\n\u2018Wo ... Woland, seems like ...\u2019\n\nOr maybe not Woland?", "Maybe not Woland.", "Maybe Faland.", "It turned out that in the foreigners\u2019 bureau they had heard precisely\n\nnothing either about any Woland, or for that matter any Faland, the\n\nmagician.", "The messenger Karpov said that this same magician was supposedly\n\nstaying in Likhodeev\u2019s apartment.", "The apartment was, of course, visited at\n\nonce \u2014 no magician was found there.", "Likhodeev himself was not there\n\neither.", "The housekeeper Grunya was not there, and where she had gone\n\nnobody knew.", "The chairman of the management, Nikanor Ivanovich, was\n\nnot there, Bedsornev was not there!", "Something utterly preposterous was coming out: the whole top\n\nadministration had vanished, a strange, scandalous seance had taken place\n\nthe day before, but who had produced it and at whose prompting, no one\n\nknew.", "And meanwhile it was drawing towards noon, when the box office was to\n\nopen.", "But, of course, there could be no talk of that!", "A huge piece of\n\ncardboard was straight away posted on the doors of the Variety reading:\n\n\u2018Today\u2019s Show Cancelled\u2019.", "The line became agitated, beginning at its head,\n\nbut after some agitation, it nevertheless began to break up, and about an\n\nhour later no trace of it remained on Sadovaya.", "The investigation departed\n\nto continue its work elsewhere, the staff was sent home, leaving only the\n\nwatchmen, and the doors of the Variety were locked.", "The bookkeeper Vassily Stepanovich had urgently to perform two tasks.", "First, to go to the Commission on Spectacles and Entertainment of the\n\nLighter Type with a report on yesterday\u2019s events and, second, to visit the\n\nFinspectacle sector so as to turn over yesterday\u2019s receipts \u2014 21,711\n\nroubles.", "The precise and efficient Vassily Stepanovich wrapped the money in\n\nnewspaper, criss-crossed it with string, put it in his briefcase, and, knowing\n\nhis instructions very well, set out, of course, not for a bus or a tram, but for\n\nthe cab stand.", "The moment the drivers of the three cabs saw a passenger hurrying\n\ntowards the stand with a tightly stuffed briefcase, all three left empty right\n\nunder his nose, looking back at him angrily for some reason.", "Struck by this circumstance, the bookkeeper stood like a post for a long\n\ntime, trying to grasp what it might mean.", "About three minutes later, an empty cab drove up, but the driver\u2019s face\n\ntwisted the moment he saw the passenger.", "\u2018Are you free?\u2019 Vassily Stepanovich asked with a cough of surprise.", "\u2018Show your money,\u2019 the driver replied angrily, without looking at the\n\npassenger.", "With increasing amazement, the bookkeeper, pressing the precious\n\nbriefcase under his arm, pulled a ten-rouble bill from his wallet and showed\n\nit to the driver.", "\u2018I won\u2019t go!\u2019 the man said curtly.", "\u2018I beg your pardon ...\u2019 the bookkeeper tried to begin, but the driver\n\ninterrupted him.", "\u2018Got any threes?\u2019\n\nThe completely bewildered bookkeeper took two three-rouble bills from\n\nhis wallet and showed them to the driver.", "\u2018Get in,\u2019 he shouted, and slapped down the flag of the meter so that he\n\nalmost broke it.", "\u2018Let\u2019s go!\u2019\n\n\u2018No change, is that it?\u2019 the bookkeeper asked timidly.", "\u2018A pocket full of change!\u2019 the driver bawled, and the eyes in the mirror\n\nwent bloodshot.", "\u2018It\u2019s my third case today.", "And the same thing happened\n\nwith the others, too.", "Some son of a bitch gives me a tenner, I give him\n\nchange - four-fifty.", "He gets out, the scum!", "About five minutes later, I look:\n\ninstead of a tenner, it\u2019s a label from a seltzer bottle!\u2019 Here the driver uttered\n\nseveral unprintable words.", "\u2018Another one, beyond Zubovskaya.", "A tenner.", "I\n\ngive him three roubles change.", "He leaves.", "I go to my wallet, there\u2019s a bee\n\nthere \u2014 zap in the finger!", "Ah, you!", "...\u2019 and again the driver pasted on some\n\nunprintable words.", "\u2018And no tenner.", "Yesterday, in the Variety here\u2019\n\n(unprintable words), \u2019some vermin of a conjurer did a seance with ten-\n\nrouble bills\u2019 (unprintable words) ...", "The bookkeeper went numb, shrank into himself, and pretended it was\n\nthe first time he had heard even the word \u2018Variety\u2019, while thinking to\n\nhimself: \u2018Oh-oh!", "...\u2019\n\nHaving got where he had to go, having paid satisfactorily, the bookkeeper\n\nentered the building and went down the corridor towards the manager\u2019s\n\noffice, and realized on his way that he had come at the wrong time.", "Some\n\nsort of tumult reigned in the offices of the Spectacles Commission.", "A\n\nmessenger girl ran past the bookkeeper, her kerchief all pushed back on her\n\nhead and her eyes popping.", "\u2018Nothing, nothing, nothing, my dears!\u2019 she shouted, addressing no one\n\nknew whom.", "\u2018The jacket and trousers are there, but inside the jacket there\u2019s\n\nnothing!\u2019\n\nShe disappeared through some door, and straight away from behind it\n\ncame the noise of smashing dishes.", "The manager of the commission\u2019s first\n\nsector, whom the bookkeeper knew, ran out of the secretary\u2019s room, but he\n\nwas in such a state that he did not recognize the bookkeeper and\n\ndisappeared without a trace.", "Shaken by all this, the bookkeeper reached the secretary\u2019s room, which\n\nwas the anteroom to the office of the chairman of the commission, and here\n\nhe was definitively dumbfounded.", "From behind the closed door of the office came a terrible voice,\n\nundoubtedly belonging to Prokhor Petrovich, the chairman of the\n\ncommission.", "\u2018Must be scolding somebody!\u2019 the consternated bookkeeper\n\nthought and, looking around, saw something else: in a leather armchair, her\n\nhead thrown back, sobbing unrestrainedly, a wet handkerchief in her hand,\n\nlegs stretched out into the middle of the room, lay Prokhor Petrovich\u2019s\n\npersonal secretary \u2014 the beautiful Anna Richardovna.", "Anna Richardovna\u2019s chin was all smeared with lipstick, and down her\n\npeachy cheeks black streams of sodden mascara flowed from her eyelashes.", "Seeing someone come in, Anna Richardovna jumped up, rushed to the\n\nbookkeeper, clutched the lapels of his jacket, began shaking him and\n\nshouting:\n\n\u2018Thank God!", "At least one brave man has been found!", "Everybody ran\n\naway, everybody betrayed us!", "Let\u2019s go, let\u2019s go to him, I don\u2019t know what\n\nto do!\u2019 And, still sobbing, she dragged the bookkeeper into the office.", "Once in the office, the bookkeeper first of all dropped his briefcase, and\n\nall the thoughts in his head turned upside-down.", "And, it must be said, not\n\nwithout reason.", "At a huge writing desk with a massive inkstand an empty suit sat and\n\nwith a dry pen, not dipped in ink, traced on a piece of paper.", "The suit was\n\nwearing a necktie, a fountain pen stuck from its pocket, but above the collar\n\nthere was neither neck nor head, just as there were no hands sticking out of\n\nthe sleeves.", "The suit was immersed in work and completely ignored the\n\nturmoil that reigned around it.", "Hearing someone come in, the suit leaned\n\nback and from above the collar came the voice, quite familiar to the\n\nbookkeeper, of Prokhor Petrovich:\n\n\u2018What is this?", "Isn\u2019t it written on the door that I\u2019m not receiving?\u2019\n\nThe beautiful secretary shrieked and, wringing her hands, cried out:\n\n\u2018You see?", "You see?!", "He\u2019s not there!", "He\u2019s not!", "Bring him back, bring him\n\nback!\u2019\n\nHere someone peeked in the door of the office, gasped, and flew out.", "The\n\nbookkeeper felt his legs trembling and sat on the edge of a chair, but did not\n\nforget to pick up his briefcase.", "Anna Richardovna hopped around the\n\nbookkeeper, worrying his jacket, and exclaiming:\n\n\u2018I always, always stopped him when he swore by the devil!", "So now the\n\ndevil\u2019s got him!\u2019 Here the beauty ran to the writing desk and in a

goes straight to Prokhor Petrovich\n\nand sits down opposite him in the armchair.", "Well, that one ... he\u2019s the\n\nkindest-hearted man, but edgy.", "He blew up, I don\u2019t deny it.", "An edgy man,\n\nworks like an ox \u2014 he blew up.", "\u201cWhy do you barge in here unannounced?\u201d\n\nhe says.", "And that brazen-face, imagine, sprawls in the armchair and says,\n\nsmiling:

stood and shook.", "But here fate came to his aid.", "Into\n\nthe secretary\u2019s room, with calm, business-like strides, marched the police,\n\nto the number of two men.", "Seeing them, the beauty

weeping girl sitting\n\nbehind a small table on which lay special literature about various\n\nspectacles, which the girl sold.", "At that moment, the girl was not offering\n\nany of this literature to anyone, and only waved her hand at sympathetic\n\ninquiries, while at the same time, from above, from below, from the sides,\n\nand from all sections of the affiliate poured the ringing of at least twenty\n\noverwrought telephones.", "After weeping for a while, the girl suddenly gave a start and cried out\n\nhysterically:\n\n\u2018Here it comes again!\u2019 and unexpectedly began singing in a

baritone:\n\n\u2018Glorious boat, a barrel of cisco ...\u20192\n\nThe messenger\u2019s voice was joined by distant voices, the choir began to\n\nswell, and finally the song resounded in all comers of

sang an octave higher than the messenger:\n\n\u2018This young lad\u2019s ready to frisk-o!\u2019\n\nWhat struck the silent visitors to the affiliate was that the choristers,\n\nscattered in various places, sang quite harmoniously, as if the whole choir\n\nstood there with its eyes fixed on some invisible director.", "Passers-by in Vagankovsky Lane stopped by the fence of the yard,\n\nwondering at the gaiety that reigned in the affiliate.", "As soon as the first verse came to an end, the singing suddenly ceased,\n\nagain as if to a director\u2019s baton.", "The messenger quietly swore

measures, doctor, I implore you!\u2019 the girl cried hysterically.", "The secretary of the affiliate ran out to the stairs and, obviously burning\n\nwith shame and embarrassment, began falteringly:\n\n\u2018You see, doctor, we have a case of some sort of mass hypnosis, and so\n\nit\u2019s necessary that ...\u2019 He did not finish the sentence, began to choke on his\n\nwords, and

roulade and herself began singing about\n\nShilka and Nerchinsk.", "\u2018Get hold of yourself!", "Stop singing!\u2019 the doctor addressed the secretary.", "There was every indication that the secretary would himself have given\n\nanything to stop singing, but stop singing he could not, and together with\n\nthe choir he brought to the hearing of passers-by in the lane the news

of\n\nfresh-water canoeing and alpinism.", "And so today, during lunch-break, this\n\nmanager comes in ...\n\n\u2018... with some son of a bitch on his arm,\u2019 the girl went on, \u2018hailing from\n\nnobody knows where, in wretched checkered trousers, a cracked pince-nez,\n\nand ... with a completely impossible mug!", "...\u2019\n\nAnd straight away, the girl said, he recommended him to all those eating\n\nin the affiliate\u2019s dining room as a prominent specialist in organizing choral-\n\nsinging clubs.", "The faces of the future alpinists darkened, but the manager immediately\n\ncalled on everyone to cheer up, while the specialist joked a little, laughed a\n\nlittle, and swore an oath that singing takes no time at all, but that,\n\nincidentally, there was a whole load of benefits to be derived from it.", "Well, of course, as the girl said, the first to pop up were Fanov and\n\nKosarchuk, well-known affiliate toadies, who announced that they would\n\nsign up.", "Here the rest of the staff realized that there was no way around the\n\nsinging, and they, too, had to sign up for the club.", "They decided to sing\n\nduring the lunch break, since the rest of the time was taken up by\n\nLermontov and checkers.", "The manager, to set an example, declared that he\n\nwas a tenor, and everything after that went as in a bad dream.", "The\n\ncheckered specialist-choirmaster bawled out:\n\n\u2018Do, mi, sol, do!\u2019 - dragged the most bashful from behind the bookcases,\n\nwhere they had tried to save themselves from singing, told Kosarchuk he\n\nhad perfect pitch, began whining, squealing, begging them to be kind to an\n\nold singing-master, tapped the tuning fork on his knuckle, beseeched them\n\nto strike up \u2018Glorious Sea\u2019.", "Strike up they did.", "And gloriously.", "The checkered one really knew his\n\nbusiness.", "They finished the first verse.", "Here the director excused himself,\n\nsaid: \u2018Back in a minute ...\u2019, and disappeared.", "They thought he would\n\nactually come back in a minute.", "But ten minutes went by and he was not\n\nthere.", "The staff was overjoyed - he had run away!", "Then suddenly, somehow of themselves, they began the second verse.", "They were all led by Kosarchuk, who may not have had perfect pitch, but\n\ndid have a rather pleasant high tenor.", "They sang it through.", "No director!", "They moved to their places, but had not managed to sit down when, against\n\ntheir will, they began to sing.", "To stop was impossible.", "After three minutes\n\nof silence, they would strike up again.", "Silence \u2014 strike up!", "Then they\n\nrealized that they were in trouble.", "The manager locked himself in his office\n\nfrom shame!", "Here the girl\u2019s story was interrupted \u2014 the valerian had not done much\n\ngood.", "A quarter of an hour later, three trucks drove up to the fence in\n\nVagankovsky, and the entire staff of the affiliate, the manager at its head,\n\nwas loaded on to them.", "As soon as the first truck, after lurching in the gateway, drove out into the\n\nlane, the staff members, who were standing on the platform holding each\n\nother\u2019s shoulders, opened their mouths, and the whole lane resounded with\n\nthe popular song.", "The second truck picked it up, then the third.", "And so they\n\ndrove on.", "Passers-by hurrying about their own business would cast only a\n\nfleeting glance at the trucks, not surprised in the least, thinking it was a\n\ngroup excursion to the country.", "And they were indeed going to the country,\n\nthough not on an excursion, but to Professor Stravinsky\u2019s clinic.", "Half an hour later, the bookkeeper, who had lost his head completely,\n\nreached the financial sector, hoping finally to get rid of the box-office\n\nmoney.", "Having learned from experience by now, he first peeked cautiously\n\ninto the oblong hall where, behind frosted-glass windows with gold\n\nlettering, the staff was sitting.", "Here the bookkeeper discovered no signs of\n\nalarm or scandal.", "It was quiet, as it ought to be in a decent institution.", "Vassily Stepanovich stuck his head through the window with \u2018Cash\n\nDeposits\u2019 written over it, greeted some unfamiliar clerk, and politely asked\n\nfor a deposit slip.", "\u2018What do you need it for?\u2019 the clerk in the window asked.", "The bookkeeper was amazed.", "\u2018I want to turn over some cash.", "I\u2019m from the Variety.\u2019\n\n\u2018One moment,\u2019 the clerk replied and instantly closed the opening in the\n\nwindow with a grille.", "\u2018Strange!", "...\u2019 thought the bookkeeper.", "His amazement was perfectly\n\nnatural.", "It was the first time in his life that he had met with such a\n\ncircumstance.", "Everybody knows how hard it is to get money; obstacles to it\n\ncan always be found.", "But there had been no case in the bookkeeper\u2019s thirty\n\nyears of experience when anyone, either an official or a private person, had\n\nhad a hard time accepting money.", "But at last the little grille moved aside, and the bookkeeper again leaned\n\nto the window.", "\u2018Do you have a lot?\u2019 the clerk asked.", "\u2018Twenty-one thousand seven hundred and eleven roubles.\u2019\n\n\u2018Oho!\u2019 the clerk answered ironically for some reason and handed the\n\nbookkeeper a green slip.", "Knowing the form well, the bookkeeper instantly filled it out and began\n\nto untie the string on the bundle.", "When he unpacked his load, everything\n\nswam before his eyes, he murmured something painfully.", "Foreign money flitted before his eyes: there were stacks of Canadian\n\ndollars, British pounds, Dutch guldens, Latvian lats, Estonian kroons ...\n\n\u2018There he is, one of those tricksters from the Variety!\u2019 a menacing voice\n\nresounded over the dumbstruck bookkeeper.", "And straight away Vassily\n\nStepanovich was arrested.", "CHAPTER 18\n\nHapless Visitors\n\nAt the same time that the zealous bookkeeper was racing in a cab to his\n\nencounter with the self-writing suit, from first-class sleeping car no.", "9 of the\n\nKiev train, on its arrival in Moscow, there alighted, among others, a decent-\n\nlooking passenger carrying a small fibreboard suitcase.", "This passenger was\n\nnone other than the late Berlioz\u2019s uncle, Maximilian Andreevich Poplavsky,\n\nan industrial economist, who lived in Kiev on the former Institutsky Street.", "The reason for Maximilian Andreevich\u2019s coming to Moscow was a\n\ntelegram received late in the evening two days before with the following\n\ncontent:\n\nHave just been run over by tram-car at Patriarch\u2019s Ponds\n\nfuneral Friday three pm come.", "Berlioz.", "Maximilian Andreevich was considered one of the most intelligent men\n\nin Kiev, and deservedly so.", "But even the most intelligent man might have\n\nbeen nonplussed by such a telegram.", "If someone sends a telegram saying he\n\nhas been run over, it is clear that he has not died of it.", "But then, what was\n\nthis about a funeral?", "Or was he in a bad way and foreseeing death?", "That\n\nwas possible, but such precision was in the highest degree strange: how\n\ncould he know he would be buried on Friday at three pm?", "An astonishing\n\ntelegram!", "However, intelligence is granted to intelligent people so as to sort out\n\nentangled affairs.", "Very simple.", "A mistake had been made, and the message\n\nhad been distorted.", "The word \u2018have\u2019 had undoubtedly come there from\n\nsome other telegram in place of the word Berlioz\u2019, which got moved and\n\nwound up at the end of the telegram.", "With such an emendation, the meaning\n\nof the telegram became clear; though, of course, tragic.", "When the outburst of grief that struck Maximilian Andreevich\u2019s wife\n\nsubsided, he at once started preparing to go to Moscow.", "One secret about Maximilian Andreevich ought to be revealed.", "There is\n\nno arguing that he felt sorry for his wife\u2019s nephew, who had died in the\n\nbloom of life.", "But, of course, being a practical man, he realized that there\n\nwas no special need for his presence at the funeral.", "And nevertheless\n\nMaximilian Andreevich was in great haste to go to Moscow.", "What was the\n\npoint?", "The point was the apartment.", "An apartment in Moscow is a serious\n\nthing!", "For some unknown reason, Maximilian Andreevich did not like\n\nKiev,1 and the thought of moving to Moscow had been gnawing at him so\n\nmuch lately that he had even begun to sleep badly.", "He did not rejoice in the spring flooding of the Dnieper, when,\n\noverflowing the islands by the lower bank, the water merged with the\n\nhorizon.", "He did not rejoice in the staggeringly beautiful view which opened\n\nout from the foot of the monument to Prince Vladimir.", "He did not take\n\ndelight in patches of sunlight playing in springtime on the brick paths of\n\nVladimir\u2019s Hill.", "He wanted none of it, he wanted only one thing - to move\n\nto Moscow.", "Advertising in the newspapers about exchanging an apartment on\n\nInstitutsky Street in Kiev for smaller quarters in Moscow brought no\n\nresults.", "No takers were found, or if they occasionally were, their offers were\n\ndisingenuous.", "The telegram staggered Maximilian Andreevich.", "This was a moment it\n\nwould be sinful to let slip.", "Practical people know that such moments do not\n\ncome twice.", "In short, despite all obstacles, he had to succeed in inheriting his\n\nnephew\u2019s apartment on Sadovaya.", "Yes, it was difficult, very difficult, but\n\nthese difficulties had to be overcome at whatever cost.", "The experienced\n\nMaximilian Andreevich knew that the first and necessary step towards that\n\nhad to be the following: he must get himself registered, at least temporarily,\n\nas the tenant of his late nephew\u2019s three rooms.", "On Friday afternoon, Maximilian Andreevich walked through the door of\n\nthe room which housed the management of no.", "302-bis on Sadovaya Street\n\nin Moscow.", "In the narrow room, with an old poster hanging on the wall illustrating in\n\nseveral pictures the ways of resuscitating people who have drowned in the\n\nriver, an unshaven, middle-aged man with anxious eyes sat in perfect\n\nsolitude at a wooden table.", "\u2018May I see the chairman?\u2019 the industrial economist inquired politely,\n\ntaking off his hat and putting his suitcase on a vacant chair.", "This seemingly simple little question for some reason so upset the seated\n\nman that he even changed countenance.", "Looking sideways in anxiety, he\n\nmuttered unintelligibly that the chairman was not there.", "\u2018Is he at home?\u2019 asked Poplavsky.", "\u2018I\u2019ve come on the most urgent\n\nbusiness.\u2019\n\nThe seated man again replied quite incoherently, but all the same one\n\ncould guess that the chairman was not at home.", "\u2018And when will he be here?\u2019\n\nThe seated man made no reply to this and looked with a certain anguish\n\nout the window.", "\u2018Aha !...\u2019 the intelligent Poplavsky said to himself and inquired about the\n\nsecretary.", "The strange man at the table even turned purple with strain and said,\n\nagain unintelligibly, that the secretary was not there either ... he did not\n\nknow when he would be back, and ... that the secretary was sick ...\n\n\u2018Aha!", "...\u2019 Poplavsky said to himself.", "\u2018But surely there\u2019s somebody in the\n\nmanagement?\u2019\n\n\u2018Me,\u2019 the man responded in a weak voice.", "\u2018You see,\u2019 Poplavsky began to speak imposingly, \u2018I am the sole heir of\n\nthe late Berlioz, my nephew, who, as you know, died at the Patriarch\u2019s\n\nPonds, and I am obliged, in accordance with the law, to take over the\n\ninheritance contained in our apartment no.", "50 ...\u2019\n\n\u2018I\u2019m not informed, comrade ...\u2019 the man interrupted in anguish.", "\u2018But, excuse me,\u2019 Poplavsky said in a sonorous voice, \u2018you are a member\n\nof the management and are obliged ...\u2019\n\nAnd here some citizen entered the room.", "At the sight of the entering man,\n\nthe man seated at the table turned pale.", "\u2018Management member Pyatnazhko?\u2019 the entering man asked the seated\n\nman.", "\u2018Yes,\u2019 the latter said, barely audibly.", "The entering one whispered something to the seated one, and he,\n\nthoroughly upset, rose from his chair, and a few seconds later Poplavsky\n\nfound himself alone in the empty management room.", "\u2018Eh, what a complication!", "As if on purpose, all of them at once ...\u2019\n\nPoplavsky thought in vexation, crossing the asphalt courtyard and hurrying\n\nto apartment no.", "50.", "As soon as the industrial economist rang, the door was opened, and\n\nMaximilian Andreevich entered the semi-dark front hall.", "It was a somewhat\n\nsurprising circumstance that he could not figure out who had let him in:\n\nthere was no one in the front hall except an enormous black cat sitting on a\n\nchair.", "Maximilian Andreevich coughed, stamped his feet, and then the door of\n\nthe study opened and Koroviev came out to the front hall.", "Maximilian\n\nAndreevich bowed politely, but with dignity, and said:\n\n\u2018My name is Poplavsky.", "I am the uncle ...\u2019\n\nBut before he could finish, Koroviev snatched a dirty handkerchief from\n\nhis pocket, buried his nose in it, and began to weep.", "\u2018... of the late Berlioz ...\u2019\n\n\u2018Of course, of course!\u2019 Koroviev interrupted, taking his handkerchief\n\naway from his face.", "\u2018Just one look and I knew it was you!\u2019 Here he was\n\nshaken with tears and began to exclaim: \u2018Such a calamity, eh?", "What\u2019s going\n\non here, eh?\u2019\n\n\u2018Run over by a tram-car?\u2019 Poplavsky asked in a whisper.", "\u2018Clean!\u2019 cried Koroviev, and tears flowed in streams from under his\n\npince-nez.", "\u2018Run clean over!", "I was a witness.", "Believe me - bang!", "and the\n\nhead\u2019s gone!", "Crunch \u2014 there goes the right leg!", "Crunch \u2014 there goes the\n\nleft leg!", "That\u2019s what these trams have brought us to!\u2019 And, obviously unable\n\nto control himself, Koroviev pecked the wall beside the mirror with his nose\n\nand began to shake with sobs.", "Berlioz\u2019s uncle was genuinely struck by the stranger\u2019s behaviour.", "\u2018And\n\nthey say there are no warm-hearted people in our time!\u2019 he thought, feeling\n\nhis own eyes beginning to itch.", "However, at the same time, an unpleasant\n\nlittle cloud came over his soul, and straight away the snake-like thought\n\nflashed in him that this warm-hearted man might perchance have registered\n\nhimself in the deceased man\u2019s apartment, for such examples have been\n\nknown in this life.", "\u2018Forgive me, were you a friend of my late Misha?\u2019 he asked, wiping his\n\ndry left eye with his sleeve, and with his right eye studying the racked-with-\n\ngrief Koroviev.", "But the man was sobbing so much that one could\n\nunderstand nothing except the repeated word \u2018crunch!\u2019 Having sobbed his\n\nfill, Koroviev finally unglued himself from the wall and said:\n\n\u2018No, I can\u2019t take any more!", "I\u2019ll go and swallow three hundred drops of\n\ntincture of valerian ...\u2019 And turning his completely tear-bathed face to\n\nPoplavsky, he added: \u2018That\u2019s trams for you!\u2019\n\n\u2018Pardon me, but did you send me the telegram?\u2019 Maximilian Andreevich\n\nasked, painfully puzzling over who this astonishing cry-baby might be.", "\u2018He did!\u2019 replied Koroviev, and he pointed his finger at the cat.", "Poplavsky goggled his eyes, assuming he had not heard right.", "\u2018No, it\u2019s too much, I just can\u2019t,\u2018 Koroviev went on, snuffing his nose,\n\n\u2019when I remember: the wheel over the leg ... the wheel alone weighs three\n\nhundred pounds ... Crunch!", "... I\u2019ll go to bed, forget myself in sleep.\u2018 And\n\nhere he disappeared from the hall.", "The cat then stirred, jumped off the chair, stood on his hind legs, front\n\nlegs akimbo, opened his maw and said:\n\nWell, so I sent the telegram.", "What of it?\u2018\n\nMaximilian Andreevich\u2019s head at once began to spin, his arms and legs\n\nwent numb, he dropped the suitcase and sat down on a chair facing the cat.", "\u2018I believe I asked in good Russian?\u2019 the cat said sternly.", "\u2018What of it?\u2019\n\nBut Poplavsky made no reply.", "\u2018Passport!\u20192 barked the cat, holding out a plump paw.", "Understanding nothing and seeing nothing except the two sparks burning\n\nin the cat\u2019s eyes, Poplavsky snatched the passport from his pocket like a\n\ndagger.", "The cat picked up a pair of glasses in thick black frames from the\n\npier-glass table, put them on his muzzle, thus acquiring a still more\n\nimposing air, and took the passport from Poplavsky\u2019s twitching hand.", "\u2018I wonder, am I going to faint or not?", "...\u2019 thought Poplavsky.", "From far\n\naway came Koroviev\u2019s snivelling, the whole front hall filled with the smell\n\nof ether, valerian and some other nauseating vileness.", "\u2018What office issued this document?\u2019 the cat asked, peering at the page.", "No answer came.", "The 412th,\u2018 the cat said to himself,

and, goggling his eyes at the garden\n\nfence, began pointing off somewhere with his finger.", "Margarita turned to where Azazello was pointing, but found nothing\n\nspecial there.", "Then she turned back to Azazello, wishing to get an\n\nexplanation of this absurd \u2018Hah!\u2019 but there was no one to give an\n\nexplanation: Margarita Nikolaevna\u2019s mysterious interlocutor had\n\ndisappeared.", "Margarita quickly thrust her hand into her handbag, where she had put\n\nthe box before this shouting, and made sure it was there.", "Then, without\n\nreflecting on anything, Margarita hurriedly ran out of the Alexandrovsky\n\nGarden.", "CHAPTER 20\n\nAzazello\u2019s Cream\n\nThe moon in the clear evening sky hung full, visible through the maple\n\nbranches.", "Lindens and

Nikolaevna\u2019s bedroom all\n\nthe lamps were burning, illuminating the total disorder in the room.", "On the blanket on the bed lay shifts, stockings and underwear.", "Crumpled\n\nunderwear was also simply lying about on the floor next to a box of\n\ncigarettes crushed in the excitement.", "Shoes stood on the night table next to\n\nan unfinished cup of coffee and an ashtray in which a butt was smoking.", "A\n\nblack evening dress hung over the back of a chair.", "The room smelled of\n\nperfume.", "Besides that, the smell of a red-hot iron was coming from\n\nsomewhere.", "Margarita Nikolaevna sat in front of the pier-glass, with just a bathrobe\n\nthrown over her naked body, and in black suede shoes.", "A gold bracelet with\n\na watch lay in front of Margarita Nikolaevna, beside the box she had\n\nreceived from Azazello, and Margarita did not take her eyes from its face.", "At times it began to seem to her that the watch was broken and the hands\n\nwere not moving.", "But they were moving, though very slowly, as if sticking,\n\nand at last the big hand fell on the twenty-ninth minute past nine.", "Margarita\u2019s heart gave a terrible thump, so that she could not even take hold\n\nof the box right away.", "Having mastered herself, Margarita opened it and\n\nsaw in the box a rich, yellowish cream.", "It seemed to her that it smelled of\n\nswamp slime.", "With the tip of her finger, Margarita put a small dab of the\n\ncream on her palm, the smell of swamp grass and forest grew stronger, and\n\nthen she began rubbing the cream into her forehead and cheeks with her\n\npalm.", "The cream spread easily and, as it seemed to Margarita, evaporated at\n\nonce.", "Having rubbed several times, Margarita glanced into the mirror and\n\ndropped the box right on her watch crystal, which became covered with\n\ncracks.", "Margarita closed her eyes, then glanced once again and burst into\n\nstormy laughter.", "Her eyebrows, plucked to a thread with tweezers, thickened and lay in\n\neven black arches over her greening eyes.", "The thin vertical crease cutting\n\nthe bridge of her nose, which had appeared back then, in October, when the\n\nmaster vanished, disappeared without a trace.", "So did the yellowish shadows\n\nat her temples and the two barely noticeable little webs of wrinkles at the\n\nouter comers of her eyes.", "The skin of her cheeks filled out with an even\n\npink colour, her forehead became white and clear, and the hairdresser\u2019s\n\nwaves in her hair came undone.", "From the mirror a naturally curly, black-haired woman of about twenty\n\nwas looking at the thirty-year-old Margarita, baring her teeth and shaking\n\nwith laughter.", "Having laughed her fill, Margarita jumped out of her bathrobe with a\n\nsingle leap, dipped freely into the light, rich cream, and with vigorous\n\nstrokes began rubbing it into the skin of her body.", "It at once turned pink and\n\ntingly.", "That instant, as if a needle had been snatched from her brain, the\n\nache she had felt in her temple all evening after the meeting in the\n\nAlexandrovsky Garden subsided, her leg and arm muscles grew stronger,\n\nand then Margarita\u2019s body became weightless.", "She sprang up and hung in the air just above the rug, then was slowly\n\npulled down and descended.", "\u2018What a cream!", "What a cream!\u2019 cried Margarita, throwing herself into an\n\narmchair.", "The rubbings changed her not only externally.", "Now joy was boiling up in\n\nher, in all of her, in every particle of her body, which felt to her like bubbles\n\nprickling her body all over.", "Margarita felt herself free, free of everything.", "Besides, she understood with perfect clarity that what was happening was\n\nprecisely what her presentiment had been telling her in the morning, and\n\nthat she was leaving her house and her former life for ever.", "But, even so, a\n\nthought split off from this former life about the need of fulfilling just one\n\nlast duty before the start of something new, extraordinary, which was\n\npulling her upwards into the air.", "And, naked as she was, she ran from her\n\nbedroom, flying up in the air time and again, to her husband\u2019s study, and,\n\nturning on the light, rushed to the desk.", "On a page torn from a notebook,\n\nshe pencilled a note quickly and in big letters, without any corrections:\n\nForgive me and forget me as soon as possible.", "I am leaving you for ever.", "Do\n\nnot look for me, it is useless.", "I have become a witch from the grief and\n\ncalamities that have struck me.", "It\u2019s time for me to go.", "Farewell.", "Margarita.", "With a completely unburdened soul, Margarita came flying into the\n\nbedroom, and after her ran Natasha, loaded down with things.", "At once all\n\nthese things - a wooden hanger with a dress, lace shawls, dark blue satin\n\nshoes on shoe-trees and a belt \u2014 all of it spilled on the floor, and Natasha\n\nclasped her freed hands.", "\u2018What, nice?\u2019 Margarita Nikolaevna cried loudly in a hoarse voice.", "\u2018How can it be?\u2019 Natasha whispered, backing away.", "\u2018How did you do it,\n\nMargarita Nikolaevna.\u2019\n\n\u2018It\u2019s the cream!", "The cream, the cream!\u2019 answered Margarita, pointing to\n\nthe glittering golden box and turning around in front of the mirror.", "Natasha, forgetting the wrinkled dress lying on the floor, ran up to the\n\npier-glass and fixed her greedy, lit-up eyes on the remainder of the cream.", "Her lips were whispering something.", "She again turned to Margarita and said\n\nwith a sort of awe:\n\n\u2018And, oh, the skin!", "The skin!", "Margarita Nikolaevna, your skin is\n\nglowing!\u2019 But she came to her senses, ran to the dress, picked it up and\n\nbegan shaking it out.", "\u2018Leave it!", "Leave it!\u2019 Margarita shouted to her.", "\u2018Devil take it!", "Leave it all!", "Or, no, keep it as a souvenir.", "As a souvenir, I tell you.", "Take everything in\n\nthe room!\u2019\n\nAs if half-witted, the motionless Natasha looked at Margarita for some\n\ntime, then hung on her neck, kissing her and crying out:\n\n\u2018Satin!", "Glowing!", "Satin!", "And the eyebrows, the eyebrows!\u2019\n\n\u2018Take all these rags, take the perfume, drag it to your trunk, hide it,\u2019 cried\n\nMargarita, \u2018but don\u2019t take any valuables, they\u2019ll accuse you of stealing.\u2019\n\nNatasha grabbed and bundled up whatever came to her hand \u2014 dresses,\n\nshoes, stockings, underwear - and ran out of the bedroom.", "Just then from somewhere at the other end of the lane a thundering,\n\nvirtuoso waltz burst and flew out an open window, and the chugging of a\n\ncar driving up to the gate was heard.", "\u2018Azazello will call now!\u2019 exclaimed Margarita, listening to the waltz\n\nspilling into the lane.", "\u2018He\u2019ll call!", "And the foreigner\u2019s not dangerous, yes, I\n\nunderstand now that he\u2019s not dangerous!\u2019\n\nThere was the noise of a car driving away from the front gate.", "The garden\n\ngate banged, and steps were heard on the tiles of the path.", "\u2018It\u2019s Nikolai Ivanovich, I recognize his footsteps,\u2018 thought Margarita.", "\u2019I\n\nmust do something funny and interesting in farewell.\u2018\n\nMargarita tore the curtain open and sat sideways on the window-sill, her\n\narms around her knees.", "Moonlight licked her from the right side.", "Margarita\n\nraised her head towards the moon and made a pensive and poetic face.", "The\n\nsteps tapped twice more, and then suddenly - silence.", "After admiring the\n\nmoon a little longer, sighing for the sake of propriety, Margarita turned her\n\nhead to the garden and indeed saw Nikolai Ivanovich, who lived on the\n\nbottom floor of the same house.", "Moonlight poured down brightly on\n\nNikolai Ivanovich.", "He was sitting on a bench, and there was every\n\nindication that he had sunk on to it suddenly.", "The pince-nez on his face was\n\nsomehow askew, and he was clutching his briefcase in his hands.", "\u2018Ah, hello, Nikolai Ivanovich,\u2019 Margarita said in a melancholy voice.", "\u2018Good evening!", "Coming back from a meeting?\u2019\n\nNikolai Ivanovich made no reply to that.", "\u2018And I,\u2019 Margarita went on, leaning further out into the garden, \u2018am\n\nsitting alone, as you see, bored, looking at the moon and listening to the\n\nwaltz...\u2019\n\nMargarita passed her left hand over her temple, straightening a strand of\n\nhair, then said crossly:\n\n\u2018That is impolite, Nikolai Ivanovich!", "I\u2019m still a woman after all!", "It\u2019s\n\nboorish not to reply when someone is talking to you.\u2019\n\nNikolai Ivanovich, visible in the moonlight to the last button on his grey\n\nwaistcoat, to the last hair of his blond, wedge-shaped beard, suddenly\n\nsmiled a wild smile, rose from the bench, and, apparently beside himself\n\nwith embarrassment, instead of taking off his hat, waved his briefcase to the\n\nside and bent his knees as if about to break into a squatting dance.", "\u2018Ah, what a boring type you are, Nikolai Ivanovich!\u2019 Margarita went on.", "\u2018Generally, I\u2019m so sick of you all that I can\u2019t even tell you, and I\u2019m so\n\nhappy to be parting with you!", "Well, go to the devil\u2019s dam!\u2019\n\nJust then, behind Margarita\u2019s back in the bedroom, the telephone\n\nexploded.", "Margarita tore from the window-sill and, forgetting Nikolai\n\nIvanovich, snatched the receiver.", "\u2018Azazello speaking,\u2019 came from the receiver.", "\u2018Dear, dear Azazello!\u2019 cried Margarita.", "\u2018It\u2019s time.", "Take off,\u2019 Azazello spoke into the receiver, and it could be\n\nheard in his tone that he liked Margarita\u2019s sincere and joyful impulse.", "\u2018When you fly over the gate, shout \u201cInvisible!\u201d Then fly over the city a\n\nlittle, to get used to it, and after that head south, out of the city, and straight\n\nfor the river.", "You\u2019re expected!\u2019\n\nMargarita hung up, and here something in the next room hobbled\n\nwoodenly and started beating on the door.", "Margarita flung it open and a\n\nsweeping broom, bristles up, flew dancing into the bedroom.", "It drummed on\n\nthe floor with its end, kicking and straining towards the window.", "Margarita\n\nsquealed with delight and jumped astride the broom.", "Only now did the\n\nthought flash in the rider that amidst all this fracas she had forgotten to get\n\ndressed.", "She galloped over to the bed and grabbed the first thing she found,\n\nsome light blue shift.", "Waving it like a banner, she flew out the window.", "And\n\nthe waltz over the garden struck up louder.", "From the window Margarita slipped down and saw Nikolai Ivanovich on\n\nthe bench.", "He seemed to have frozen to it and listened completely\n\ndumbfounded to the shouting and crashing coming from the lighted\n\nbedroom of the upstairs tenants.", "\u2018Farewell, Nikolai Ivanovich!\u2019 cried Margarita, capering in front of\n\nNikolai Ivanovich.", "He gasped and crawled along the bench, pawing it with his hands and\n\nknocking down his briefcase.", "\u2018Farewell for ever!", "I\u2019m flying away!\u2019 Margarita shouted above the waltz.", "Here she realized that she did not need any shift, and with a sinister guffaw\n\nthrew it over Nikolai Ivanovich\u2019s head.", "The blinded Nikolai Ivanovich\n\ncrashed from the bench on to the bricks of the path.", "Margarita turned to take a last look at the house where she had suffered\n\nfor so long, and saw in the blazing window Natasha\u2019s face distorted with\n\namazement.", "\u2018Farewell, Natasha!\u2019 Margarita cried and reared up on the broom.", "\u2018Invisible!", "Invisible!\u2019 she cried still louder, and, flying over the front gates,\n\nbetween the maple branches, which lashed at her face, she flew out into the\n\nlane.", "And after her flew the completely insane waltz.", "CHAPTER 21\n\nFlight\n\nInvisible and free!", "Invisible and free!", "... After flying down her own lane,\n\nMargarita got into another that crossed the first at right angles.", "This patched\n\nup, darned, crooked and long lane, with the lopsided door of a kerosene\n\nshop where they sold paraffin by the cup and liquid against parasites in\n\nflacons, she cut across in an instant, and here she realized that, even while\n\ncompletely free and invisible, she still had to be at least somewhat\n\nreasonable in her pleasure.", "Having slowed down only by some miracle, she\n\njust missed smashing herself to death against an old lopsided street light at\n\nthe corner.", "Dodging it, Margarita clutched the broom tighter and flew more\n\nslowly, studying the electric wires and the street signs hanging across the\n\nsidewalk.", "The third lane led straight to the Arbat.", "Here Margarita became fully\n\naccustomed to controlling the broom, realized that it obeyed the slightest\n\ntouch of her hands and legs, and that, flying over the city, she had to be very\n\nattentive and not act up too much.", "Besides, in the lane it had already\n\nbecome abundantly clear that passers-by did not see the lady flier.", "No one\n\nthrew his head back, shouted \u2018Look!", "look!\u2019 or dashed aside, no one\n\nshrieked, swooned or guffawed with wild laughter.", "Margarita flew noiselessly, very slowly, and not high up, approximately\n\non second-floor level.", "But even with this slow flying, just at the entrance to\n\nthe dazzlingly lit Arbat she misjudged slightly and struck her shoulder\n\nagainst some illuminated disc with an arrow on it.", "This angered Margarita.", "She reined in the obedient broom, flew a little aside, and then, suddenly\n\nhurling herself at the disc with the butt of the broom, smashed it to\n\nsmithereens.", "Bits of glass rained down with a crash, passers-by shied away,\n\na whistle came from somewhere, and Margarita, having accomplished this\n\nunnecessary act, burst out laughing.", "\u2018On the Arbat I must be more careful,\u2019 thought Margarita, \u2018everything\u2019s\n\nin such a snarl here, you can\u2019t figure it out.\u2019 She began dodging between the\n\nwires.", "Beneath Margarita floated the roofs of buses, trams and cars, and\n\nalong the sidewalks, as it seemed to Margarita from above, floated rivers of\n\ncaps.", "From these rivers little streams branched off and flowed into the\n\nflaming maws of night-time shops.", "\u2018Eh, what a mess!\u2019 Margarita thought angrily.", "\u2018You can\u2019t even turn\n\naround here.\u2019\n\nShe crossed the Arbat, rose higher, to fourth-floor level, and, past the\n\ndazzlingly bright tubes on the theatre building at the comer, floated into a\n\nnarrow lane with tall buildings.", "All the windows in them were open, and\n\neverywhere radio music came from the windows.", "Out of curiosity,\n\nMargarita peeked into one of them.", "She saw a kitchen.", "Two primuses were\n\nroaring on the range, and next to them stood two women with spoons in\n\ntheir hands, squabbling.", "\u2018You should turn the toilet light off after you, that\u2019s what I\u2019m telling you,\n\nPelageya Petrovna,\u2019 said the woman before whom there was a pot with\n\nsome sort of eatables steaming in it, \u2018or else we\u2019ll apply to have you\n\nevicted.\u2019\n\n\u2018You\u2019re a good one yourself,\u2019 the other woman answered.", "\u2018You\u2019re both good ones,\u2019 Margarita said loudly, clambering over the\n\nwindow-sill into the kitchen.", "The two quarrelling women turned towards the voice and froze with their\n\ndirty spoons in their hands.", "Margarita carefully reached out between them,\n\nturned the knobs of both primuses, and extinguished them.", "The women\n\ngasped and opened their mouths.", "But Margarita was already bored with the\n\nkitchen and flew out into the lane.", "Her attention was attracted by the magnificent hulk of an eight-storeyed,\n\nobviously just-constructed building at the end of it.", "Margarita dropped\n\ndown and, alighting, saw that the fa\u00e7ade of the building was covered in\n\nblack marble, that the doors were wide, that behind their glass could be\n\nglimpsed a doorman\u2019s buttons and peaked cap with gold braid, and that over\n\nthe door there was a gold inscription: \u2018Dramlit House\u2019.", "Margarita squinted at the inscription, trying to figure out what the word\n\n\u2018Dramlit\u2019 might mean.", "Taking her broom under her arm, Margarita walked\n\ninto the lobby, shoving the surprised doorman with the door, and saw on the\n\nwall beside the elevator a huge black board and on it, written in white\n\nletters, apartment numbers and tenants\u2019 names.", "The heading \u2019House of\n\nDramatists and Literary Workers\u2019 above the list provoked a suppressed\n\npredatory scream in Margarita.", "Rising in the air, she greedily began to read\n\nthe last names: Khustov, Dvubratsky, Quant, Beskudnikov, Latunsky ...\n\n\u2018Latunsky!\u2019 shrieked Margarita.", "\u2018Latunsky!", "Why, he\u2019s the one ... he\u2019s the\n\none who ruined the master!\u2019\n\nThe doorman at the entrance, even hopping with astonishment, his eyes\n\nrolled out, gazed at the black board, trying to understand the marvel: why\n\nwas the list of tenants suddenly shrieking?", "But by that time Margarita was already going impetuously up the stairs,\n\nrepeating in some sort of rapture:\n\n\u2018Latunsky eighty-four ... Latunsky eighty-four ...\u2019\n\nHere to the left - 82, to the right - 83, further up, to the left - 84!", "Here!", "And the name plate - \u2018O.", "Latunsky\u2019.", "Margarita jumped off the broom, and her hot soles felt the pleasant\n\ncoolness of the stone landing.", "Margarita rang once, twice.", "But no one\n\nopened.", "Margarita began to push the button harder and could hear the\n\njangling it set off in Latunsky\u2019s apartment.", "Yes, to his dying day the\n\ninhabitant of apartment no.", "84 on the eighth floor should be grateful to the\n\nlate Berlioz, chairman of Massolit, for having fallen under a tram-car, and\n\nthat the memorial gathering had been appointed precisely for that evening.", "The critic Latunsky was born under a lucky star \u2014 it saved him from\n\nmeeting Margarita, who that Friday became a witch.", "No one opened the door.", "Then Margarita raced down at full swing,\n\ncounting the floors, reached the bottom, burst out the door and, looking up,\n\ncounted and checked the floors from outside, guessing which precisely were\n\nthe windows of Latunsky\u2019s apartment.", "Undoubtedly they were the five dark\n\nwindows at the comer of the building on the eighth floor.", "Convinced of it,\n\nMargarita rose into the air and in a few seconds was stepping through an\n\nopen window into an unlit room, where only a narrow path from the moon\n\nshone silver.", "Margarita ran down it, felt for the switch.", "A moment later the\n\nwhole apartment was lit up.", "The broom stood in a comer.", "After making sure\n\nthat no one was home, Margarita opened the door to the stairs and checked\n\nwhether the name plate was there.", "The name plate was in place.", "Margarita\n\nwas where she wanted to be.", "Yes, they say that to this day the critic Latunsky turns pale remembering\n\nthat terrible evening, and to this day he utters the name of Berlioz with\n\nveneration.", "It is totally unknown what dark and vile criminal job would\n\nhave marked this evening - returning from the kitchen, Margarita had a\n\nheavy hammer in her hands.", "Naked and invisible, the lady flier tried to control and talk sense into\n\nherself;

the little curtain aside and flew in.", "\u2018I\u2019m afraid,\u2019 the boy repeated, and trembled.", "\u2018Don\u2019t be afraid, don\u2019t be afraid, little one,\u2019 said Margarita, trying to\n\nsoften her criminal voice, grown husky from the wind.", "\u2018It\u2019s some boys\n\nbreaking windows.\u2019\n\n\u2018With a slingshot?\u2019 the boy asked, ceasing to tremble.", "\u2018With a slingshot, with a slingshot,\u2019 Margarita confirmed, \u2018and you go to\n\nsleep.\u2019\n\n\u2018It\u2019s Sitnik,\u2019 said the boy, \u2018he\u2019s got a slingshot.\u2019\n\n\u2018Well, of course it\u2019s he!\u2019\n\nThe boy looked slyly somewhere to the side and asked:\n\n\u2018And where are you, ma\u2019am?\u2018\n\n\u2018I\u2019m nowhere,\u2019 answered Margarita, \u2018I\u2019m your dream.\u2019\n\n\u2018I thought so,\u2019 said the boy.", "\u2018Lie down now,\u2019 Margarita ordered, \u2018put your hand under your cheek,\n\nand I\u2019ll go on being your dream.\u2019\n\n\u2018Well, be my dream, then,\u2019 the boy agreed, and at once lay down and put\n\nhis hand under his cheek.", "\u2018I\u2019ll tell you a story,\u2019 Margarita began, and placed her hot hand on his\n\ncropped head.", "\u2018Once there was a certain lady ... And she had no children,\n\nand generally no happiness either.", "And so first she cried for a long time, and\n\nthen she became wicked ...\u2019 Margarita fell silent and took away her hand -\n\nthe boy was asleep.", "Margarita quietly placed the hammer on the window-sill and flew out the\n\nwindow.", "There was turmoil by the building.", "On the asphalt pavement\n\nstrewn with broken glass, people were running and shouting something.", "Policemen were already flashing among them.", "Suddenly a bell rang, and a\n\nred fire-engine with a ladder drove into the lane from the Arbat.", "But what followed no longer interested Margarita.", "Taking aim, so as not\n\nto brush against any wires, she clutched her broom more tightly and in a\n\nmoment was high above the ill-fated house.", "The lane beneath her went\n\naskew and plunged away.", "In place of it a mass of roofs appeared under\n\nMargarita\u2019s feet, criss-crossed at various angles by shining paths.", "It all\n\nunexpectedly went off to one side, and the strings of lights smeared and\n\nmerged.", "Margarita made one more spurt and the whole mass of roofs fell through\n\nthe earth, and in place of it a lake of quivering electric lights appeared\n\nbelow, and this lake suddenly rose up vertically and then appeared over\n\nMargarita\u2019s head, while the moon flashed under her feet.", "Realizing that she\n\nhad flipped over, Margarita resumed a normal position and, glancing back,\n\nsaw that there was no longer any lake, and that there behind her only a pink\n\nglow remained on the horizon.", "That, too, disappeared a second later, and\n\nMargarita saw that she was alone with the moon flying above and to the left\n\nof her.", "Margarita\u2019s hair had long been standing up in a shock, and the\n\nwhistling moonlight bathed her body.", "Seeing two rows of widespread lights\n\nmerge into two unbroken fiery lines, seeing how quickly they vanished\n\nbehind her, Margarita realized that she was flying at an enormous speed and\n\nwas amazed that she was not out of breath.", "After a few seconds, a new glow of electric lights flared up far below in\n\nthe earthly blackness and hurtled under the flying woman\u2019s feet, but\n\nimmediately spun away like a whirligig and fell into the earth.", "A few\n\nseconds later \u2014 exactly the same phenomenon.", "\u2018Towns!", "Towns!\u2019 cried Margarita.", "Two or three times after that she saw dully gleaming sabres lying in open\n\nblack sheaths below her and realized that these were rivers.", "Turning her head up and to the left, the flying woman admired the way\n\nthe moon madly raced back over her towards Moscow, and at the same time\n\nstrangely stayed in its place, so that there could be clearly seen on it\n\nsomething mysterious, dark \u2014 a dragon, or a little humpbacked horse, its\n\nsharp muzzle turned to the abandoned city.", "Here the thought came to Margarita that, in fact, there was no need for\n\nher to drive her broom so furiously, that she was depriving herself of the\n\nopportunity of seeing anything properly, of revelling properly in her own\n\nflight.", "Something told her that she would be waited for in the place she was\n\nflying to, and that there was no need for her to become bored with this\n\ninsane speed and height.", "Margarita turned the broom\u2019s bristles forward, so that its tail rose up, and,\n\nslowing way down, headed right for the earth.", "This downward glide, as on\n\nan airy sled, gave her the greatest pleasure.", "The earth rose to meet her, and\n\nin its hitherto formless black density the charms and secrets of the earth on\n\na moonlit night revealed themselves.", "The earth was coming to her, and\n\nMargarita was already enveloped in the scent of greening forests.", "Margarita\n\nwas flying just above the mists of a dewy meadow, then over a pond.", "Under\n\nMargarita sang a chorus of frogs, and from somewhere far away, stirring her\n\nheart deeply for some reason, came the noise of a train.", "Soon Margarita saw\n\nit.", "It was crawling slowly along like a caterpillar, spraying sparks into the\n\nair.", "Going ahead of it, Margarita passed over yet another watery mirror, in\n\nwhich a second moon floated under her feet, dropped down lower still and\n\nwent on, her feet nearly touching the tops of the huge pines.", "A heavy noise of ripping air came from behind and began to overtake\n\nMargarita.", "To this noise of something flying like a cannon ball a woman\u2019s\n\nguffaw was gradually added, audible for many miles around.", "Margarita\n\nlooked back and saw some complex dark object catching up with her.", "As it\n\ndrew nearer to Margarita, it became more distinct \u2014 a mounted flying\n\nperson could be seen.", "And finally it became quite distinct: slowing down,\n\nNatasha came abreast of Margarita.", "Completely naked, her dishevelled hair flying in the air, she flew astride\n\na fat hog, who was clutching a briefcase in his front hoofs, while his hind\n\nhoofs desperately threshed the air.", "Occasionally gleaming in the moonlight,\n\nthen fading, the pince-nez that had fallen off his nose flew beside the hog\n\non a string, and the hog\u2019s hat kept sliding down over his eyes.", "Taking a\n\nclose look, Margarita recognized the hog as Nikolai Ivanovich, and then her\n\nlaughter rang out over the forest, mingled with the laughter of Natasha.", "\u2018Natashka!\u2019 Margarita shouted piercingly.", "\u2018You rubbed yourself with the\n\ncream?\u2019\n\n\u2018Darling!", "!\u2019 Natasha replied, awakening the sleeping pine forest with her\n\nshout.", "\u2018My French queen, I smeared it on him, too, on his bald head!\u2019\n\n\u2018Princess!\u2019 the hog shouted tearfully, galloping along with his rider.", "\u2018Darling!", "Margarita Nikolaevna!\u2019 cried Natasha, riding beside Margarita,\n\n\u2018I confess, I took the cream!", "We, too, want to live and fly!", "Forgive me, my\n\nsovereign lady, I won\u2019t go back, not for anything!", "Ah, it\u2019s good, Margarita\n\nNikolaevna!", "...", "He propositioned me,\u2019 Natasha began jabbing her finger into\n\nthe neck of the abashedly huffing hog, \u2018propositioned me!", "What was it you\n\ncalled me, eh?\u2019 she shouted, leaning towards the hog\u2019s ear.", "\u2018Goddess!\u2019 howled the hog, \u2018I can\u2019t fly so fast!", "I may lose important\n\npapers, Natalya Prokofyevna, I protest!\u2019\n\n\u2018Ah, devil take you and your papers!\u2019 Natasha shouted with a brazen\n\nguffaw.", "\u2018Please, Natalya Prokofyevna, someone may hear us!\u2019 the hog yelled\n\nimploringly.", "Flying beside Margarita, Natasha laughingly told her what happened in\n\nthe house after Margarita Nikolaevna flew off over the gates.", "Natasha confessed that, without ever touching any of the things she had\n\nbeen given, she threw off her clothes, rushed to the cream, and immediately\n\nsmeared herself with it.", "The same thing happened with her as with her\n\nmistress.", "Just as Natasha, laughing with joy, was revelling in her own\n\nmagical beauty before the mirror, the door opened and Nikolai Ivanovich\n\nappeared before her.", "He was agitated; in his hands he was holding\n\nMargarita Nikolaevna\u2019s shift and his own hat and briefcase.", "Seeing Natasha,\n\nNikolai Ivanovich was dumbfounded.", "Getting some control of himself, all\n\nred as a lobster, he announced that he felt it was his duty to pick up the little\n\nshift and bring it personally ...\n\n\u2018The things he said, the blackguard!\u2019 Natasha shrieked and laughed.", "\u2018The\n\nthings he said, the things he tempted me to do!", "The money he promised!", "He\n\nsaid Klavdia Petrovna would never learn of it.", "Well, speak, am I lying?\u2019\n\nNatasha shouted to the hog, who only turned his muzzle away abashedly.", "In the bedroom, carried away with her own mischief, Natasha dabbed\n\nsome cream on Nikolai Ivanovich and was herself struck dumb with\n\nastonishment.", "The respectable ground-floor tenant\u2019s face shrank to a pig\u2019s\n\nsnout, and his hands and feet acquired little hoofs.", "Looking at himself in the\n\nmirror, Nikolai Ivanovich let out a wild and desperate howl, but it was\n\nalready too late.", "A few seconds later, saddled up, he was flying out of\n\nMoscow to devil knows where, sobbing with grief.", "\u2018I demand that my normal appearance be restored to me!\u2019 the hog\n\nsuddenly grunted hoarsely, somewhere between frenzy and supplication.", "\u2018I\u2019m not going to fly to any illegal gathering!", "Margarita Nikolaevna, it\u2019s\n\nyour duty to call your housekeeper to order!\u2019\n\n\u2018Ah, so now I\u2019m a housekeeper?", "A housekeeper?\u2019 Natasha cried,\n\npinching the hog\u2019s ear.", "\u2018And I used to be a goddess?", "What was it you called\n\nme?\u2019\n\n\u2018Venus!\u2019 the hog replied tearfully, as he flew over a brook bubbling\n\nbetween stones, his little hoofs brushing the hazel bushes.", "\u2018Venus!", "Venus!\u2019 Natasha cried triumphantly, one hand on her hip, the\n\nother stretched out towards the moon.", "\u2018Margarita!", "Queen!", "Intercede for me\n\nso that I can stay a witch!", "They\u2019ll do anything for you, you have been\n\ngranted power!\u2019\n\nAnd Margarita responded:\n\n\u2018All right, I promise.\u2019\n\n\u2018Thank you!\u2019 exclaimed Natasha, and suddenly she cried out sharply and\n\nsomehow longingly: \u2018Hey!", "Hey!", "Faster!", "Faster!", "Come on, speed it up!\u2019\n\nShe dug her heels into the hog\u2019s sides, which had grown thinner during\n\nthis insane ride, and he tore on, so that the air ripped open again, and a\n\nmoment later Natasha could be seen only as a black speck in the distance,\n\nthen vanished completely, and the noise of her flight melted away.", "Margarita flew as slowly as before through the deserted and unfamiliar\n\nplace, over hills strewn with occasional boulders among huge, widely\n\nspaced pines.", "Margarita now flew not over the tops of the pines but between\n\ntheir trunks, silvered on one side by the moon.", "The light shadow of the\n\nflying woman glided over the ground ahead, the moon shining now on\n\nMargarita\u2019s back.", "Margarita sensed the proximity of water, and guessed that her goal was\n\nnear.", "The pines parted and Margarita rode slowly through the air up to a\n\nchalk cliff.", "Beyond this cliff, down in the shadows, lay a river.", "Mist hung\n\nclinging to the bushes on the cliff, but the opposite bank was flat and low.", "On it, under a solitary group of spreading trees, the light of a bonfire\n\nflickered and some small figures could be seen moving about.", "It seemed to\n\nMargarita that some nagging, merry little tune was coming from there.", "Further off, as far as the eye could see, there was no sign of habitation or\n\npeople on the silvered plain.", "Margarita leaped off the cliff and quickly descended to the water.", "The\n\nwater enticed her after her airy race.", "Casting the broom aside, she ran and\n\nthrew herself head first into the water.", "Her light body pierced the water\u2019s\n\nsurface like an arrow, and the column of water thrown up almost reached\n\nthe moon.", "The water turned out to be warm as in a bathhouse, and,\n\nemerging from the depths, Margarita swam her fill in the total solitude of\n\nnight in this river.", "There was no one near Margarita, but a little further away, behind the\n\nbushes, splashing and grunting could be heard \u2014 someone was also having\n\na swim there.", "Margarita ran out on to the bank.", "Her body was on fire after the swim.", "She felt no fatigue, and was joyfully capering about on the moist grass.", "Suddenly she stopped dancing and pricked up her ears.", "The grunting\n\ncame closer, and from behind the willow bushes some naked fat man\n\nemerged, with a black silk top hat pushed back on his head.", "His feet were\n\ncovered with slimy mud, which made it seem that the swimmer was\n\nwearing black shoes.", "Judging by his huffing and hiccuping, he was properly\n\ndrunk, as was confirmed, incidentally, by the fact that the river suddenly\n\nbegan to smell of cognac.", "Seeing Margarita, the fat man peered at her and then shouted joyfully:\n\n\u2018What\u2019s this?", "Who is it I see?", "Claudine, it\u2019s you, the ungrieving widow!", "You\u2019re here, too?\u2019 and he came at her with his greetings.", "Margarita stepped back and replied with dignity:\n\n\u2018Go to the devil!", "What sort of Claudine am I to you?", "Watch out who\n\nyou\u2019re talking to,\u2019 and, after a moment\u2019s reflection, she added to her words\n\na long, unprintable oath.", "All this had a sobering effect on the light-minded\n\nfat man.", "\u2018Ah!\u2019 he exclaimed softly and gave a start, \u2018magnanimously forgive me,\n\nbright Queen Margot!", "I mistook you for someone else.", "The cognac\u2019s to\n\nblame, curse it!\u2019 The fat man lowered himself to one knee, holding the top\n\nhat far out, made a bow, and started to prattle, mixing Russian phrases with\n\nFrench, some nonsense about the bloody wedding of his friend Guessard in\n\nParis, and about the cognac, and about being mortified by his sad mistake.", "\u2018Why don\u2019t you put your trousers on, you son of a bitch,\u2019 Margarita said,\n\nsoftening.", "The fat man grinned joyfully, seeing that Margarita was not angry, and\n\nrapturously declared that he found himself without trousers at the given\n\nmoment only because in his absent-mindedness he had left them on the\n\nYenisey River, where he had been swimming just before, but that he would\n\npresently fly there, since it was close at hand, and then, entrusting himself\n\nto her favour and patronage, he began to back away and went on backing\n\naway until he slipped and fell backwards into the water.", "But even as he fell,\n\nhe kept on his face, framed in small side-whiskers, a smile of rapture and\n\ndevotion.", "Here Margarita gave a piercing whistle and, mounting the broom that\n\nflew up to her, crossed to the opposite bank of the river.", "The shadow of the\n\nchalk mountain did not reach that far, and the whole bank was flooded with\n\nmoonlight.", "As soon as Margarita touched the moist grass, the music under the pussy\n\nwillows struck up louder, and a sheaf of sparks flew up more merrily from\n\nthe bonfire.", "Under the pussy-willow branches, strewn with tender, fluffy\n\ncatkins, visible in the moonlight, sat two rows of fat-faced frogs, puffing up\n\nas if they were made of rubber, playing a bravura march on wooden pipes.", "Glowing marsh-lights hung on willow twigs in front of the musicians,\n\nlighting up the music; the restless light of the bonfire danced on the frogs\u2019\n\nfaces.", "The march was being played in honour of Margarita.", "She was given a\n\nmost solemn reception.", "Transparent naiads stopped their round dance over\n\nthe river and waved weeds at Margarita, and their far-audible greetings\n\nmoaned across the deserted, greenish bank.", "Naked witches, jumping from\n\nbehind the pussy willows, formed a line and began curtseying and making\n\ncourtly bows.", "Someone goat-legged flew up and bent to her hand, spread\n\nsilk on the grass, inquired whether the queen had had a good swim, and\n\ninvited her to lie down and rest.", "Margarita did just that.", "The goat-legged one offered her a glass of\n\nchampagne, she drank it, and her heart became warm at once.", "Having\n\ninquired about Natasha\u2019s whereabouts, she received the reply that Natasha\n\nhad already taken her swim and had flown ahead to Moscow on her hog, to\n\nwarn them that Margarita would soon arrive and to help prepare her attire.", "Margarita\u2019s short stay under the pussy willows was marked by one\n\nepisode: there was a whistling in the air, and a black body, obviously\n\nmissing its mark, dropped into the water.", "A few moments later there stood\n\nbefore Margarita that same fat side-whiskerist who had so unsuccessfully\n\nintroduced himself on the other bank.", "He had apparently managed to get to\n\nthe Yenisey and back, for he was in full evening dress, though wet from\n\nhead to foot.", "The cognac had done him another bad turn: as he came down,\n\nhe landed in the water after all.", "But he did not lose his smile even on this\n\nlamentable occasion, and the laughing Margarita admitted him to her hand.", "Then they all started getting ready.", "The naiads finished their dance in the\n\nmoonlight and melted into it.", "The goat-legged one deferentially inquired of\n\nMargarita how she had come to the river.", "On learning that she had come\n\nriding on a broom, he said:\n\n\u2018Oh, but why, it\u2019s so inconvenient!\u2019 He instantly slapped together some\n\ndubious-looking telephone from two twigs, and demanded of someone that\n\na car be sent that very minute, which, that same minute, was actually done.", "An open, light sorrel car came down on the island, only in the driver\u2019s seat\n\nthere sat no ordinary-looking driver, but a black, long-beaked rook in an\n\noilcloth cap and gauntlets.", "The little island was becoming deserted.", "The\n\nwitches flew off, melting into the moon-blaze.", "The bonfire was dying down,\n\nand the coals were covering over with hoary ash.", "The goat-legged one helped Margarita in, and she sank on to the wide\n\nback seat of the sorrel car.", "The car roared, sprang up, and climbed almost to\n\nthe moon; the island vanished, the river vanished, Margarita was racing to\n\nMoscow.", "CHAPTER 22\n\nBy Candlelight\n\nThe steady humming of the car, flying high above the earth, lulled\n\nMargarita, and the moonlight warmed her pleasantly.", "Closing her eyes, she\n\noffered her face to the wind and thought with a certain sadness about the\n\nunknown river bank she had left behind, which she sensed she would never\n\nsee again.", "After all the sorceries and wonders of that evening, she could\n\nalready guess precisely whom she was being taken to visit, but that did not\n\nfrighten her.", "The hope that there she would manage to regain her happiness\n\nmade her fearless.", "However, she was not to dream of this happiness for long\n\nin the car.", "Either the rook knew his job well, or the car was a good one, but\n\nMargarita soon opened her eyes and saw beneath her not the forest\n\ndarkness, but a quivering sea of Moscow lights.", "The black bird-driver\n\nunscrewed the right front wheel in flight, then landed the car in some\n\ncompletely deserted cemetery in the Dorogomilovo area.", "Having deposited the unquestioning Margarita by one of the graves along\n\nwith her broom, the rook started the car, aiming it straight into the ravine\n\nbeyond the cemetery.", "It tumbled noisily into it and there perished.", "The rook\n\nsaluted deferentially, mounted the wheel, and flew off.", "A black cloak appeared at once from behind one of the tombstones.", "A\n\nfang flashed in the moonlight, and Margarita recognized Azazello.", "He\n\ngestured to Margarita, inviting her to get on the broom, jumped on to a long\n\nrapier himself, they both whirled up and in a few seconds, unnoticed by\n\nanyone, landed near no.", "302-bis on Sadovaya Street.", "When the companions passed through the gateway, carrying the broom\n\nand rapier under their arms, Margarita noticed a man languishing there in a\n\ncap and high boots, probably waiting for someone.", "Light though Azazello\u2019s\n\nand Margarita\u2019s footsteps were, the solitary man heard them and twitched\n\nuneasily, not understanding who had produced them.", "By the sixth entrance they met a second man looking surprisingly like the\n\nfirst.", "And again the same story repeated itself.", "Footsteps ... the man turned\n\nand frowned uneasily.", "And when the door opened and closed, he dashed\n\nafter the invisible enterers, peeked into the front hall, but of course saw\n\nnothing.", "A third man, the exact copy of the second, and therefore also of the first,\n\nstood watch on the third-floor landing.", "He smoked strong cigarettes, and\n\nMargarita had a fit of coughing as she walked past him.", "The smoker, as if\n\npricked with a pin, jumped up from the bench he was sitting on, began\n\nturning around uneasily, went to the banister, looked down.", "Margarita and\n\nher companion were by that time already at the door of apartment no.", "50.", "They did not ring the bell.", "Azazello noiselessly opened the door with his\n\nown key.", "The first thing that struck Margarita was the darkness in which she found\n\nherself.", "It was as dark as underground, so that she involuntarily clutched at\n\nAzazello\u2019s cloak for fear of stumbling.", "But then, from far away and above,\n\nthe light of some little lamp flickered and began to approach.", "Azazello took\n\nthe broom from under Margarita\u2019s arm as they walked, and it disappeared\n\nwithout a sound in the darkness.", "Here they started climbing some wide steps, and Margarita began to think\n\nthere would be no end to them.", "She was struck that the front hall of an\n\nordinary Moscow apartment could contain this extraordinary invisible, yet\n\nquite palpable, endless stairway.", "But the climb ended, and Margarita\n\nrealized that she was on a landing.", "The light came right up to them, and\n\nMargarita saw in this light the face of a man, long and black, holding a little\n\nlamp in his hand.", "Those who in recent days had been so unfortunate as to\n\ncross paths with him, would certainly have recognized him even by the faint\n\ntongue of flame from the lamp.", "It was Koroviev, alias Fagott.", "True, Koroviev\u2019s appearance was quite changed.", "The flickering light was\n\nreflected not in the cracked pince-nez, which it had long been time to throw\n\nin the trash, but in a monocle, which, true, was also cracked.", "The little\n\nmoustache on his insolent face was twirled up and waxed, and Koroviev\u2019s\n\nblackness was quite simply explained \u2014 he was in formal attire.", "Only his\n\nchest was white.", "The magician, choirmaster, sorcerer, interpreter - devil knows what he\n\nreally was \u2014 Koroviev, in short, made his bows and, with a broad sweep of\n\nthe lamp in the air, invited Margarita to follow

at this buffoon.", "See what he\u2019s turned himself into under\n\nthe bed!\u2019\n\nStanding on his hind legs, the dust-covered cat was meanwhile making\n\nhis bows to Margarita.", "There was now a

trousers?\u2019\n\n\u2018A cat is not supposed to wear trousers, Messire,\u2019 the cat replied with\n\ngreat dignity.", "\u2018You\u2019re not going to tell me to wear boots, too, are you?",

chucked out!", "Everyone adorns himself with what he\n\ncan.", "You may consider what I\u2019ve said as referring to the opera glasses as\n\nwell, Messire!\u2019\n\n\u2018But the whiskers?",

prepared to.", "admit it a thousand times over.", "But\n\ngenerally,\u2019 here the cat\u2019s voice quavered touchily, \u2018I see I am being made\n\nthe object of a certain captiousness, and I see that a serious problem stands\n\nbefore me \u2014 am I to attend the ball?", "What have you to say about that,\n\nMessire?\u2019\n\nAnd the cat got so puffed up with offence that it seemed he would burst\n\nin another second.", "\u2018Ah, the cheat, the cheat,\u2019 said Woland, shaking his head.", "\u2018Each time his\n\ngame is in a hopeless situation, he starts addling your pate like the

an\n\nobjection with regard to your last.", "My speeches in no way resemble verbal\n\nmuck, as you have been pleased to put it in the presence of a lady, but rather\n\na sequence of tightly packed syllogisms, the merit of which would be\n\nappreciated by such connoisseurs as Sextus Empiricus, Martianus Capella,4\n\nand, for all I know, Aristotle himself.\u2019\n\n\u2018Your king is in check,\u2019 said Woland.", "\u2018Very well, very well,\u2019 responded the cat, and he began studying the\n\nchessboard through his opera glasses.", "\u2018And so, donna,\u2019 Woland addressed Margarita, \u2018I present to you my\n\nretinue.", "This one who is playing the fool is the cat Behemoth.", "Azazello and\n\nKoroviev you have already met.", "I present to you my maid-servant, Hella:\n\nefficient, quick, and there is no service she cannot render.\u2019\n\nThe beautiful Hella was smiling as she turned her green-tinged eyes to\n\nMargarita, without ceasing to dip into the ointment and apply it to Woland\u2019s\n\nknee.", "\u2018Well, that\u2019s the lot,\u2019 Woland concluded, wincing as Hella pressed\n\nespecially hard on his knee.", "\u2018A small, mixed and guileless company, as you\n\nsee.\u2019 He fell silent and began to spin the globe in front of him, which was so\n\nartfully made that the blue oceans moved on it and the cap at the pole lay\n\nlike a real cap of ice and snow.", "On the chessboard, meanwhile, confusion was setting in.", "A thoroughly\n\nupset king in a white mantle was shuffling on his square, desperately raising\n\nhis arms.", "Three white pawn-mercenaries with halberds gazed in perplexity\n\nat the bishop brandishing his crozier and pointing forward to where, on two\n\nadjacent squares, white and black, Woland\u2019s black horsemen could be seen\n\non two fiery chargers pawing the squares with their hoofs.", "Margarita was extremely interested and struck by the fact that the\n\nchessmen were alive.", "The cat, taking the opera glasses from his eyes, prodded his king lightly\n\nin the back.", "The king covered his face with his hands in despair.", "Things aren\u2019t so great, my dear Behemoth,\u2018 Koroviev said quietly in a\n\nvenomous voice.", "The situation is serious but by no means hopeless,\u2018 Behemoth responded.", "\u2019What\u2019s more, I\u2019m quite certain of final victory.", "Once I\u2019ve analysed the\n\nsituation properly.\u2018\n\nHe set about this analysing in a rather strange manner \u2014 namely, by\n\nwinking and making all sorts of faces at his king.", "\u2018Nothing helps,\u2019 observed Koroviev.", "\u2018Aie!\u2019 cried Behemoth, \u2018the parrots have flown away, just as I predicted!\u2019\n\nIndeed, from somewhere far away came the noise of many wings.", "Koroviev and Azazello rushed out of the room.", "\u2018Devil take you with your ball amusements!\u2019 Woland grunted without\n\ntearing his eyes from his globe.", "As soon as Koroviev and Azazello disappeared, Behemoth\u2019s winking\n\ntook on greater dimensions.", "The white king finally understood what was\n\nwanted of him.", "He suddenly pulled off his mantle, dropped it on the square,\n\nand ran off the board.", "The bishop covered himself with the abandoned royal\n\ngarb and took the king\u2019s place.", "Koroviev and Azazello came back.", "\u2018Lies, as usual,\u2019

check!\u2019\n\n\u2018Messire,\u2019 the cat responded in a falsely alarmed voice, \u2018you are\n\novertired.", "My king is not in check.\u2019\n\nThe king is on square G-2,\u2018 said Woland, without looking at the board.", "\u2018Messire, I\u2019m horrified!\u2019 howled the cat, showing horror on his mug.", "There is no king on that square!\u2018\n\n\u2018What\u2019s that?\u2019 Woland asked in perplexity and began looking at the\n\nboard, where the bishop standing on the king\u2019s square kept turning away\n\nand hiding behind his hand.", "\u2018Ah, you scoundrel,\u2019 Woland said pensively.", "\u2018Messire!", "Again I appeal to logic!\u2019 the cat began, pressing his paws to his\n\nchest.", "\u2018If a player announces that the king is in check, and meanwhile\n\nthere\u2019s no trace of the king on the board, the check must be recognized as\n\ninvalid!\u2019\n\n\u2018Do you give up or not?\u2019 Woland cried in a terrible voice.", "\u2018Let me think it over,\u2019 the cat replied humbly, resting his elbows on the\n\ntable, putting his paws over his ears, and beginning to think.", "He thought for\n\na long time and finally said: \u2018I give up.\u2019\n\n\u2018The obstinate beast should be killed,\u2019 whispered Azazello.", "\u2018Yes, I give up,\u2019 said the cat, \u2018but I do so only because I am unable to\n\nplay in an atmosphere of persecution on the part of the envious!\u2019 He stood\n\nup and the chessmen climbed into their box.", "\u2018Hella, it\u2019s time,\u2019 said Woland, and Hella disappeared from the room.", "\u2018My leg hurts, and now this ball ...\u2019 he continued.", "\u2018Allow me,\u2019 Margarita quietly asked.", "Woland looked at her intently and moved his knee towards her.", "The liquid, hot as lava, burned her hands, but Margarita, without wincing,\n\nand trying not to cause any pain, rubbed it into his knee.", "\u2018My attendants insist it\u2019s rheumatism,\u2019 Woland was saying, not taking his\n\neyes off Margarita, \u2018but I strongly suspect that this pain in my knee was left\n\nme as a souvenir by a charming witch with whom I was closely acquainted\n\nin the year 1571, on Mount Brocken, 5 on the Devil\u2019s Podium.\u2019\n\n\u2018Ah, can that be so!\u2019 said Margarita.", "\u2018Nonsense!", "In another three hundred years it will all go away!", "I\u2019ve been\n\nrecommended a host of medications, but I keep to my granny\u2019s old ways.", "Amazing herbs she left me, my grandam, that vile old thing!", "Incidentally,\n\ntell me, are you suffering from anything?", "Perhaps you have some sort of\n\nsorrow or soul-poisoning anguish?\u2019\n\n\u2018No, Messire, none of that,\u2019 replied the clever Margarita, \u2018and now that\n\nI\u2019m here with you, I feel myself quite well.\u2019\n\n\u2018Blood is a great thing ...\u2019 Woland said gaily, with no obvious point, and\n\nadded: \u2018I see you\u2019re interested in my globe.\u2019\n\n\u2018Oh, yes, I\u2019ve never seen anything like it.\u2019\n\n\u2018It\u2019s a nice little object.", "Frankly speaking, I don\u2019t enjoy listening to the\n\nnews on the radio.",

globe is much more\n\nconvenient, especially since I need a precise knowledge of events.", "For\n\ninstance, do you see this chunk of land, washed on one side by the ocean?", "Look, it\u2019s filling with fire.", "A war has started there.", "If you look closer, you\u2019ll\n\nsee the details.\u2019\n\nMargarita leaned towards the globe and saw the little square of land\n\nspread out, get painted in many colours, and turn as it were into a relief\n\nmap.", "And then she saw the little ribbon of a river, and some village near it.", "A little house the size of a pea grew and became the size of a matchbox.", "Suddenly and noiselessly the roof of this house flew up along with a cloud\n\nof black smoke, and the walls collapsed, so that nothing was left of the little\n\ntwo-storey box except a small heap with black smoke pouring from it.", "Bringing her eye still closer, Margarita made out a small female figure lying\n\non the ground, and next to her, in a pool of blood, a little child with\n\noutstretched arms.", "\u2018That\u2019s it,\u2019 Woland said, smiling, \u2018he had no time to sin.", "Abaddon\u2019s6\n\nwork is impeccable.\u2018\n\n\u2018I wouldn\u2019t want to be on the

you are very intelligent.", "I\u2019ll set you at ease.", "He is of a rare\n\nimpartiality and sympathizes equally with both sides of the fight.", "Owing to\n\nthat, the results are always the same for both sides.", "Abaddon!\u2018 Woland\n\ncalled in a low voice, and here there emerged from the wall the figure of\n\nsome gaunt man in dark glasses.", "These glasses produced such a strong\n\nimpression on Margarita that she cried out softly and hid her face in\n\nWoland\u2019s leg.", "\u2019Ah, stop it!\u2018 cried Woland.", "\u2019Modern people are so nervous!\u2018\n\nHe swung and slapped Margarita on the back so that a ringing went through\n\nher whole body.", "\u2019Don\u2019t you see he\u2019s got his glasses on?", "Besides, there has\n\nnever yet been, and never will be, an occasion when Abaddon appears\n\nbefore someone prematurely.", "And, finally, I\u2019m here.", "You are my guest!", "I\n\nsimply wanted to show him to you.\u2018\n\nAbaddon stood motionless.", "\u2018And is it possible for him to take off his glasses for a second?\u2019 Margarita\n\nasked, pressing herself to Woland and shuddering, but now from curiosity.", "\u2018Ah, no, that\u2019s impossible,\u2019 Woland replied seriously and waved his hand\n\nat Abaddon, and he was no more.", "\u2018What do you wish to say, Azazello?\u2019\n\n\u2018Messire,\u2019 replied Azazello, \u2018allow me to say - we\u2019ve got two strangers\n\nhere: a beauty who is whimpering and pleading to be allowed to stay with\n\nher lady, and with her, begging your pardon, there is also her hog.\u2019\n\n\u2018Strange behaviour for a beauty!\u2019 observed Woland.", "\u2018It\u2019s Natasha, Natasha!\u2019 exclaimed Margarita.", "\u2018Well, let her stay with her lady.", "And the hog - to the cooks.\u2019\n\n\u2018To slaughter him?\u2019 Margarita cried fearfully.", "\u2018For pity\u2019s sake, Messire,\n\nit\u2019s Nikolai Ivanovich, the ground-floor tenant.", "It\u2019s a misunderstanding, you\n\nsee, she daubed him with the cream ...\u2019\n\n\u2018But wait,\u2019 said Woland, \u2018why the devil would anyone slaughter him?", "Let\n\nhim stay with the cooks, that\u2019s all.", "You must agree, I cannot let him into the\n\nballroom.\u2019\n\n\u2018No, really ...\u2019 Azazello added and announced: \u2018Midnight is approaching,\n\nMessire.\u2019\n\n\u2018Ah, very good.\u2019 Woland turned to Margarita: \u2018And so, if you please ...", "I\n\nthank you beforehand.", "Don\u2019t become flustered and don\u2019t be afraid of\n\nanything.", "Drink nothing but water, otherwise you\u2019ll get groggy and it will\n\nbe hard for you.", "It\u2019s time!\u2019\n\nMargarita got up from the rug, and then Koroviev appeared in the\n\ndoorway.", "CHAPTER 23\n\nThe Great Ball at Satan\u2019s\n\nMidnight was approaching; they had to hurry.", "Margarita dimly perceived\n\nher surroundings.", "Candles and a jewelled pool remained in her memory.", "As\n\nshe stood in the bottom of this pool, Hella, with the assistance of Natasha,\n\ndoused her with some hot, thick and red liquid.", "Margarita felt a salty taste\n\non her lips and realized that she was being washed in blood.", "The bloody\n\nmantle was changed for another \u2014 thick, transparent, pinkish - and\n\nMargarita\u2019s head began to spin from rose oil.", "Then Margarita was laid on a\n\ncrystal couch and rubbed with some big green leaves until she shone.", "Here the cat burst in and started to help.", "He squatted down at Margarita\u2019s\n\nfeet and began rubbing up her soles with the air of someone shining shoes\n\nin the street.", "Margarita does not remember who stitched slippers for her from pale rose\n\npetals or how these slippers got fastened by themselves with golden clasps.", "Some force snatched Margarita up and put her before a mirror, and a royal\n\ndiamond crown gleamed in her hair.", "Koroviev appeared from somewhere\n\nand hung a heavy, oval-framed picture of a black poodle by a heavy chain\n\non Margarita\u2019s breast.", "This adornment was extremely burdensome to the\n\nqueen.", "The chain at once began to chafe her neck, the picture pulled her\n\ndown.", "But something compensated Margarita for the inconveniences that\n\nthe chain with the black poodle caused her, and this was the deference with\n\nwhich Koroviev and Behemoth began to treat her.", "\u2018Never mind, never mind, never mind!\u2019 muttered Koroviev at the door of\n\nthe room with the pool.", "\u2018No help for it, you must, must, must ...", "Allow me,\n\nQueen, to give you a last piece of advice.", "Among the guests there will be\n\ndifferent sorts, oh, very different, but no one, Queen Margot, should be\n\nshown any preference!", "Even if you don\u2019t like someone ...", "I understand that\n\nyou will not, of course, show it on your face - no, no, it\u2019s unthinkable!", "He\u2019ll\n\nnotice it, he\u2019ll notice it instantly!", "You must love him, love him, Queen!", "The\n\nmistress of the ball will be rewarded a hundredfold for that.", "And also -\n\ndon\u2019t ignore anyone!", "At least a little smile, if there\u2019s no time to drop a\n\nword, at least a tiny turn of the head!", "Anything you like, but not inattention,\n\nthey\u2019ll sicken from that...\u2019\n\nHere Margarita, accompanied by Koroviev and Behemoth, stepped out of\n\nthe room with the pool into total darkness.", "\u2018I, I,\u2019 whispered the cat, \u2018I give the signal!\u2019\n\n\u2018Go ahead!\u2019 Koroviev replied from the darkness.", "The ball!!", "!\u2018 shrieked the cat piercingly, and just then Margarita cried out\n\nand shut her eyes for a few seconds.", "The ball fell on her all at once in the\n\nform of light, and, with it, of sound and smell.", "Taken under the arm by\n\nKoroviev, Margarita saw herself in a tropical forest.", "Red-breasted, green-\n\ntailed parrots fluttered from liana to liana and cried out deafeningly:\n\n\u2019Delighted!\u2018 But the forest soon ended, and its bathhouse stuffiness changed\n\nat once to the coolness of a ballroom with columns of some yellowish,\n\nsparkling stone.", "This ballroom, just like the forest, was completely empty,\n\nexcept for some naked negroes with silver bands on their heads who were\n\nstanding by the columns.", "Their faces turned a dirty brown from excitement\n\nwhen Margarita flew into the ballroom with her retinue, in which Azazello\n\nshowed up from somewhere.", "Here Koroviev let go of Margarita\u2019s arm and\n\nwhispered:\n\n\u2018Straight to the tulips.\u2019\n\nA low wall of white tulips had grown up in front of Margarita, and\n\nbeyond it she saw numberless lamps under little shades and behind them the\n\nwhite chests and black shoulders of tailcoaters.", "Then Margarita understood\n\nwhere the sound of the ball was coming from.", "The roar of trumpets crashed\n\ndown on her, and the soaring of violins that burst from under it doused her\n\nbody as if with blood.", "The orchestra of about a hundred and fifty men was\n\nplaying a polonaise.", "The tailcoated man hovering over the orchestra paled on seeing\n\nMargarita, smiled, and suddenly, with a sweep of his arms, got the whole\n\norchestra to its feet.", "Not interrupting the music for a moment, the orchestra,\n\nstanding, doused Margarita with sound.", "The man over the orchestra turned\n\nfrom it and bowed deeply, spreading his arms wide, and Margarita, smiling,\n\nwaved her hand to him.", "\u2018No, not enough, not enough,\u2019 whispered Koroviev, \u2018he won\u2019t sleep all\n\nnight.", "Call out to him: \u201cGreetings to you, waltz king!\u201d \u20191\n\nMargarita cried it out, and marvelled that her voice, full as a bell, was\n\nheard over the howling of the orchestra.", "The man started with happiness\n\nand put his left hand to his chest, while the right went on brandishing a\n\nwhite baton at the orchestra.", "\u2018Not enough, not enough,\u2019 whispered Koroviev, \u2018look to the left, to the\n\nfirst violins, and nod so that each one thinks you\u2019ve recognized him\n\nindividually.", "There are only world celebrities here.", "Nod to that one ... at the\n\nfirst stand, that\u2019s Vieuxtemps!", "2 ...", "There, very good ... Now, onward!\u2019\n\n\u2018Who is the conductor?\u2019 Margarita asked, flying off.", "\u2018Johann Strauss!\u2019 cried the cat.", "\u2018And they can hang me from a liana in a\n\ntropical forest if such an orchestra ever played at any ball!", "I invited them!", "And, note, not one got sick or declined!\u2019\n\nIn the next room there were no columns.", "Instead there stood walls of red,\n\npink and milk-white roses on one side, and on the other a wall of Japanese\n\ndouble camellias.", "Between these walls fountains spurted up, hissing, and\n\nbubbly champagne seethed in three pools, the first of which was transparent\n\nviolet, the second ruby, the third crystal.", "Next to them negroes in scarlet\n\nheadbands dashed about, filling flat cups from the pools with silver dippers.", "The pink wall had a gap in it, where a man in a red swallowtail coat was\n\nflailing away on a platform.", "Before him thundered an unbearably loud jazz\n\nband.", "As soon as the conductor saw Margarita, he bent before her so that his\n\nhands touched the floor, then straightened up and cried piercingly:\n\n\u2018Hallelujah!\u2019\n\nHe slapped himself on the knee - one!", "- then criss-cross on the other knee\n\n\u2014 two!", "- then snatched a cymbal from the hands of the end musician and\n\nbanged it on a column.", "As she flew off, Margarita saw only that the virtuoso jazzman, fighting\n\nagainst the polonaise blowing in Margarita\u2019s back, was beating his jazzmen\n\non the heads with the cymbal while they cowered in comic fright.", "Finally they flew out on to the landing where, as Margarita realized, she\n\nhad been met in the dark by Koroviev with his little lamp.", "Now on this\n\nlanding the light pouring from clusters of crystal grapes blinded the eye.", "Margarita was put in place, and under her left arm she found a low amethyst\n\ncolumn.", "\u2018You may rest your arm on it if it becomes too difficult,\u2019 Koroviev\n\nwhispered.", "Some black man threw a pillow under Margarita\u2019s feet embroidered 263\n\nwith a golden poodle, and she, obedient to someone\u2019s hands, bent her right\n\nleg at the knee and placed her foot on it.", "Margarita tried to look around.", "Koroviev and Azazello stood beside her\n\nin formal poses.", "Next to Azazello stood another three young men, vaguely\n\nreminding Margarita of Abaddon.", "It blew cold in her back.", "Looking there,\n\nMargarita saw bubbly wine spurt from the marble wall behind her and pour\n\ninto a pool of ice.", "At her left foot she felt something warm and furry.", "It was\n\nBehemoth.", "Margarita was high up, and a grandiose stairway covered with carpet\n\ndescended from her feet.", "Below, so far away that it was as if Margarita were\n\nlooking the wrong way through binoculars, she saw a vast front hall with an\n\nabsolutely enormous fireplace, into the cold and black maw of which a five-\n\nton truck could easily have driven.", "The front hall and stairway, so flooded\n\nwith light that it hurt the eyes, were empty.", "The sound of trumpets now\n\ncame to Margarita from far away.", "Thus they stood motionless for about a\n\nminute.", "\u2018But where are the guests?\u2019 Margarita asked Koroviev.", "\u2018They\u2019ll come, Queen, they\u2019ll come, they\u2019ll come soon enough.", "There\u2019ll\n\nbe no lack of them.", "And, really, I\u2019d rather go and chop wood than receive\n\nthem here on the landing.\u2019\n\n\u2018Chop wood \u2014 hahl\u2019 picked up the garrulous cat.", "\u2019I\u2019d rather work as a\n\ntram conductor, and there\u2019s no worse job in the world than that!\u2018\n\n\u2018Everything must be made ready in advance, Queen,\u2019 explained\n\nKoroviev, his eye gleaming through the broken monocle.", "\u2018There\u2019s nothing\n\nmore loathsome than when the first guest to arrive languishes, not knowing\n\nwhat to do, and his lawful beldame nags at him in a whisper for having\n\ncome before everybody else.", "Such balls should be thrown in the trash,\n\nQueen.\u2019\n\n\u2018Definitely in the trash,\u2019 confirmed the cat.", "\u2018No more than ten seconds till midnight,\u2019 said Koroviev.", "\u2018It\u2019ll start\n\npresently.\u2019\n\nThose ten seconds seemed extremely long to Margarita.", "Obviously they\n\nhad already passed and precisely nothing had happened.", "But here something\n\nsuddenly crashed downstairs in the huge fireplace, and from it leaped a\n\ngallows with some half-decayed remains dangling from it.", "The remains fell\n\nfrom the rope, struck the floor, and from it leaped a handsome dark-haired\n\nman in a tailcoat and patent leather shoes.", "A half-rotten little coffin ran out\n\nof the fireplace, its lid fell off, and another remains tumbled out of it.", "The\n\nhandsome man gallantly leaped over to it and offered it his bent arm.", "The\n\nsecond remains put itself together into a fidgety woman in black shoes, with\n\nblack feathers on her head, and then the man and the woman both hastened\n\nup the stairs.", "The first!\u2018 exclaimed Koroviev.", "\u2019Monsieur Jacques3 and his spouse.", "I\n\ncommend to you, Queen, one of the most interesting of men.", "A confirmed\n\ncounterfeiter, a traitor to his government, but a rather good alchemist.", "Famous,\u2018 Koroviev whispered in Margarita\u2019s ear, \u2019for having poisoned a\n\nking\u2019s mistress.", "That doesn\u2019t happen to everyone!", "Look how handsome he\n\nis!\u2018\n\nThe pale Margarita, her mouth open, watched as both gallows and coffin\n\ndisappeared into some side passage in the front hall.", "\u2018Delighted!\u2019 the cat yelled right into the face of Monsieur Jacques as he\n\ncame up the stairs.", "At that moment a headless skeleton with a torn-off arm emerged from the\n\nfireplace, struck the ground, and turned into a man in a tailcoat.", "Monsieur Jacques\u2019s spouse was already going on one knee before\n\nMargarita and, pale with excitement, was kissing Margarita\u2019s foot.", "\u2018Queen ...\u2019 Monsieur Jacques\u2019s spouse murmured.", "The queen is delighted!\u2018 cried Koroviev.", "\u2018Queen ...\u2019 the handsome Monsieur Jacques said quietly.", "\u2018We\u2019re delighted,\u2019 howled the cat.", "The young men, Azazello\u2019s companions, smiling lifeless but affable\n\nsmiles, were already shouldering Monsieur Jacques and his spouse to one\n\nside, towards the cups of champagne that the negroes were holding.", "The\n\nsingle man in the tailcoat was coming up the stairs at a run.", "\u2018Earl Robert,\u20194 Koroviev whispered to Margarita, \u2018interesting as ever.", "Note how funny, Queen: the reverse case, this one was a queen\u2019s lover and\n\npoisoned his wife.\u2019\n\n\u2018We\u2019re very glad, Earl,\u2019 cried Behemoth.", "Out of the fireplace, bursting open and falling apart, three coffins\n\ntumbled one after another, then came someone in a black mantle, whom the\n\nnext one to run out of the black maw stabbed in the back with a knife.", "A\n\nstifled cry was heard from below.", "An almost entirely decomposed corpse\n\nran out of the fireplace.", "Margarita shut her eyes, and someone\u2019s hand held a\n\nflacon of smelling salts to her nose.", "Margarita thought the hand was\n\nNatasha\u2019s.", "The stairway began to fill up.", "Now on each step there were tailcoaters,\n\nlooking quite alike from afar, and naked women with them, who differed\n\nfrom each other only in the colour of their shoes and of the feathers on their\n\nheads.", "Coming towards Margarita, hobbling, a strange wooden boot on her left\n\nfoot, was a lady with nunnishly lowered eyes, thin and modest, and with a\n\nwide green band around her neck for some reason.", "\u2018Who is this ... green one?\u2019 Margarita asked mechanically.", "\u2018A most charming and respectable lady,\u2019 whispered Koroviev, \u2018I\n\ncommend her to you: Madame Tofana.5 Extremely popular among young,\n\nlovely Neapolitans, as well as the ladies of Palermo, especially those of\n\nthem who had grown weary of their husbands.", "It does happen, Queen, that\n\none grows weary of one\u2019s husband ...\u2019\n\n\u2018Yes,\u2019 Margarita replied in a hollow voice, smiling at the same time to\n\ntwo tailcoaters who bent before her one after the other, kissing her knee and\n\nhand.", "\u2018And so,\u2019 Koroviev managed to whisper to Margarita and at the same\n\ntime to cry out to someone: \u2018Duke!", "A glass of champagne?", "I\u2019m delighted!", "...", "Yes, so then, Madame Tofana entered into the situation of these poor\n\nwomen and sold them some sort of water in little vials.", "The wife poured this\n\nwater into her spouse\u2019s soup, he ate it, thanked her for being so nice, and\n\nfelt perfectly well.", "True, a few hours later he would begin to get very\n\nthirsty, then go to bed, and a day later the lovely Neapolitan who had fed\n\nher husband soup would be free as the spring breeze.\u2019\n\n\u2018But what\u2019s that on her foot?\u2019 asked Margarita, tirelessly offering her\n\nhand to the guests who came ahead of the hobbling Madame Tofana.", "\u2018And\n\nwhy that green band?", "A withered neck?\u2019\n\n\u2018Delighted, Prince!\u2019 cried Koroviev, and at the same time whispered to\n\nMargarita: \u2018A beautiful neck, but an unpleasantness happened to her in\n\nprison.", "What she has on her foot, Queen, is a Spanish boot,6 and the band is\n\nexplained this way: when the prison guards learned that some five hundred\n\nill-chosen husbands had departed Naples and Palermo for ever, in the heat\n\nof the moment they strangled Madame Tofana in prison.\u2019\n\n\u2018How happy I am, O kindest Queen, that the high honour has fallen 266\n\nto me ...\u2019 Tofana whispered nunnishly, trying to lower herself to one knee\n\n\u2014 the Spanish boot hindered her.", "Koroviev and Behemoth helped her up.", "\u2018I\u2019m very glad,\u2019 Margarita answered her, at the same time offering her\n\nhand to others.", "Now a steady stream was coming up the stairs from below.", "Margarita\n\ncould no longer see what was going on in the front hall.", "She mechanically\n\nraised and lowered her hand and smiled uniformly to the guests.", "There was\n\na hum in the air on the landing; from the ballrooms Margarita had left,\n\nmusic could be heard, like the sea.", "\u2018But this one is a boring woman,\u2019 Koroviev no longer whispered, but\n\nspoke aloud, knowing that in the hubbub of voices no one would hear him.", "\u2018She adores balls, and keeps dreaming of complaining about her\n\nhandkerchief.\u2019\n\nMargarita\u2019s glance picked out among those coming up the woman at\n\nwhom Koroviev was pointing.", "She was young, about twenty, of remarkably\n\nbeautiful figure, but with somehow restless and importunate eyes.", "\u2018What handkerchief?\u2019 asked Margarita.", "\u2018She has a chambermaid assigned to her,\u2019 explained Koroviev, \u2018who for\n\nthirty years has been putting a handkerchief on her night table during the\n\nnight.", "She wakes up and the handkerchief is there.", "She\u2019s tried burning it in\n\nthe stove and drowning it in the river, but nothing helps.\u2019\n\n\u2018What handkerchief?\u2019 whispered Margarita, raising and lowering her\n\narm.", "\u2018A blue-bordered one.", "The thing is that when she worked in a caf\u00e9, the\n\nowner once invited her to the pantry, and nine months later she gave birth to\n\na boy, took him to the forest, stuffed the handkerchief into his mouth, and\n\nthen buried the boy in the ground.", "At the trial she said she had no way of\n\nfeeding the child.\u2019\n\n\u2018And where is the owner of the caf\u00e9?\u2019 asked Margarita.", "\u2018Queen,\u2019 the cat suddenly creaked from below, \u2018what, may I ask, does the\n\nowner have to do with it?", "It wasn\u2019t he who smothered the infant in the\n\nforest!\u2019\n\nMargarita, without ceasing to smile and proffer her right hand, dug the\n\nsharp nails of the left into Behemoth\u2019s ear and whispered to him:\n\n\u2018If you, scum, allow yourself to interfere in the conversation again ...\u2019\n\nBehemoth squeaked in a not very ball-like fashion and rasped:\n\n\u2018Queen ... the ear will get swollen ... why spoil the ball with a swollen\n\near?", "...", "I was speaking legally, from the legal point of view\n\n...", "I say no more, I say no more.", "Consider me not a cat but a post, only let\n\ngo of my ear!\u2018\n\nMargarita released his ear, and the importunate, gloomy eyes were before\n\nher.", "\u2018I am happy, Queen-hostess, to be invited to the great ball of the full\n\nmoon!\u2019\n\n\u2018And I am glad to see you,\u2019 Margarita answered her, \u2018very glad.", "Do you\n\nlike champagne?\u2019\n\n\u2018What are you doing, Queen?", "!\u2019 Koroviev cried desperately but\n\nsoundlessly in Margarita\u2019s ear.", "\u2018There\u2019ll be a traffic jam!\u2019\n\n\u2018Yes, I do,\u2019 the woman said imploringly, and suddenly began repeating\n\nmechanically: \u2018Frieda, 7 Frieda, Frieda!", "My name is Frieda, Queen!\u2019\n\n\u2018Get drunk tonight, Frieda, and don\u2019t think about anything,\u2019 said\n\nMargarita.", "Frieda reached out both arms to Margarita, but Koroviev and Behemoth\n\nvery adroitly took her under the arms and she blended into the crowd.", "Now people were coming in a solid wall from below, as if storming the\n\nlanding where Margarita stood.", "Naked women\u2019s bodies came up between\n\ntailcoated men.", "Their swarthy, white, coffee-bean-coloured, and altogether\n\nblack bodies floated towards Margarita.", "In their hair - red, black, chestnut,\n\nlight as flax - precious stones glittered and danced, spraying sparkles into\n\nthe flood of light.", "And as if someone had sprinkled the storming column of\n\nmen with droplets of light, diamond studs sprayed light from their chests.", "Every second now Margarita felt lips touch her knee, every second she held\n\nout her hand to be kissed, her face was contracted into a fixed mask of\n\ngreeting.", "\u2018I\u2019m delighted,\u2019 Koroviev sang monotonously, \u2018we\u2019re delighted ... the\n\nqueen is delighted ...\u2019\n\n\u2018The queen is delighted ...\u2019 Azazello echoed nasally behind her back.", "\u2018I\u2019m delighted!\u2019 the cat kept exclaiming.", "\u2018The marquise.. ,\u20198 muttered Koroviev, \u2018poisoned her father, two brothers\n\nand two sisters for the inheritance ...", "The queen is delighted!", "... Madame\n\nMinkin ... 9 Ah, what a beauty!", "A bit nervous.", "Why burn the maid\u2019s face\n\nwith the curling-irons?", "Of course, in such conditions one gets stabbed ...", "The queen is delighted!", "... Queen, one second of attention!", "The emperor\n\nRudolf10 \u2014 sorcerer and alchemist ...

Queen,\u2019 answered Koroviev.", "\u2018Delighted!", "...", "This twenty-year-old boy was distinguished from childhood by strange\n\nqualities, a dreamer and an eccentric.", "A girl fell in love with him, and he\n\nwent and sold her to a brothel...\u2019\n\nA river came streaming from below, and there was no end to this river in\n\nsight.", "Its source - the enormous fireplace - continued to feed it.", "Thus one\n\nhour passed and a second commenced.", "Here Margarita began to notice that\n\nher chain had become heavier than before.", "Something strange also\n\nhappened with her arm.", "Now, before raising it, Margarita had to wince.", "Koroviev\u2019s interesting observations ceased to amuse Margarita.", "Slant-eyed\n\nMongolian faces, white faces and black became undifferentiated to her, they\n\nmerged at times, and the air between them would for some reason begin to\n\ntremble and flow.", "A sharp pain, as if from a needle, suddenly pierced\n\nMargarita\u2019s right arm, and, clenching her teeth, she rested her elbow on the\n\npost.", "Some rustling, as if from wings against the walls, was now coming\n\nfrom the ballroom, and it was clear that unprecedented hordes of guests\n\nwere dancing there, and it seemed to Margarita that even the massive\n\nmarble, mosaic and crystal floors of this prodigious room were pulsing\n\nrhythmically.", "Neither Gaius Caesar Caligula12 nor Messalina13 interested Margarita any longer, nor did any of the kings, dukes, cavaliers, suicides, poisoners,\n\ngallowsbirds, procuresses, prison guards and sharpers, executioners,\n\ninformers, traitors, madmen, sleuths, seducers.", "All their names became\n\njumbled in her head, the faces stuck together into one huge pancake, and\n\nonly a single face lodged

on the floor.", "One of the goblets fell from the table and\n\nbroke.", "\u2018Pull this rabid hellion off me!\u2018wailed the cat, fighting off Hella, who\n\nwas sitting astride him.", "The combatants were separated, and Koroviev blew\n\non Hella\u2019s bullet-pierced finger and it mended.", "\u2018I can\u2019t shoot when someone\u2019s talking at my elbow!\u2019 shouted

"He\u2019s not a bad shot.\u2019\n\nHella and the cat made peace and, as a sign of their reconciliation,\n\nexchanged kisses.", "The card was taken from under the pillow and checked.", "Not a single pip had been hit, except for the one shot through by Azazello.", "\u2018That can\u2019t be,\u2019 insisted the cat, holding the card up to the light of the\n\ncandelabra.", "The merry supper went on.", "The candles guttered in the candelabra, the\n\ndry, fragrant warmth of the fireplace spread waves over the room.", "After\n\neating, Margarita was enveloped in a feeling of bliss.", "She watched the blue-\n\ngrey smoke-rings from Azazello\u2019s cigar float into the fireplace, while the\n\ncat caught them on the tip of a sword.", "She did not want to go anywhere,\n\nthough according to her reckoning it was already late.", "By all tokens, it was\n\ngetting on towards six in the morning.", "Taking advantage of a pause,\n\nMargarita turned to Woland and said timidly:\n\n\u2018I suppose it\u2019s time for me ... it\u2019s late ...\u2019\n\n\u2018What\u2019s your hurry?\u2019 asked Woland, politely but a bit drily.", "The rest kept\n\nsilent, pretending to be occupied with the smoke-rings.", "\u2018Yes, it\u2019s time,\u2019 Margarita repeated, quite embarrassed by it, and looked\n\naround as if searching for some cape or cloak.", "She was suddenly\n\nembarrassed by her nakedness.", "She got up from the table.", "Woland silently\n\ntook his worn-out and greasy dressing-gown from the bed, and Koroviev\n\nthrew it over Margarita\u2019s shoulders.", "\u2018I thank you, Messire,\u2019 Margarita said barely audibly, and looked\n\nquestioningly at Woland.", "In reply, he smiled at her courteously and\n\nindifferently.", "Black anguish somehow surged up all at once in Margarita\u2019s\n\nheart.", "She felt herself deceived.", "No rewards would be offered her for all her\n\nservices at the ball, apparently, just as no one was detaining her.", "And yet it\n\nwas perfectly clear to her that she had nowhere to go.", "The fleeting thought\n\nof having to return to her house provoked an inward burst of despair in her.", "Should she ask, as Azazello had temptingly advised in the Alexandrovsky\n\nGarden?", "\u2018No, not for anything!\u2019 she said to herself.", "\u2018Goodbye, Messire,\u2019 she said aloud, and thought, \u2018I must just get out of\n\nhere, and then I\u2019ll go to the river and drown myself.\u2019\n\n\u2018Sit down now,\u2019 Woland suddenly said imperiously.", "Margarita changed countenance and sat down.", "\u2018Perhaps you want to say something before you leave?\u2019\n\n\u2018No, nothing, Messire,\u2019 Margarita answered proudly, \u2018except that if you\n\nstill need me, I\u2019m willing and ready to do anything you wish.", "I\u2019m not tired\n\nin the least, and I had a very good time at the ball.", "So that if it were still\n\ngoing on, I would again offer my knee for thousands of gallowsbirds and\n\nmurderers to kiss.\u2019 Margarita looked at Woland as if through a veil, her eyes\n\nfilling with tears.", "\u2018True!", "You\u2019re perfectly right!\u2019 Woland cried resoundingly and terribly.",

guests,\n\nwhom you just called gallowsbirds?", "Speak!", "And speak now without\n\nconstraint, for it is I who offer.\u2019\n\nMargarita\u2019s heart began to pound, she sighed heavily, started pondering\n\nsomething.", "\u2018Well, come, be braver!\u2019 Woland encouraged her.", "\u2018Rouse your fantasy,\n\nspur it on!", "Merely being present at the scene of the murder of that inveterate\n\nblackguard of a baron is worth a reward, particularly if the person is a\n\nwoman.", "Well, then?\u2019\n\nMargarita\u2019s breath was taken away, and she was about to utter the\n\ncherished words prepared in her soul, when she suddenly turned pale,\n\nopened her mouth and stared: \u2018Frieda!", "... Frieda, Frieda!\u2019 someone\u2019s\n\nimportunate, imploring voice cried in her ears, \u2018my name is Frieda!\u2019 And\n\nMargarita, stumbling over the words, began to speak:\n\n\u2018So, that means ...", "I can ask ... for one thing?\u2019\n\n\u2018Demand, demand, my donna,\u2019 Woland replied, smiling knowingly, \u2018you\n\nmay demand one thing.\u2019\n\nAh, how adroitly and distinctly Woland, repeating Margarita\u2019s words,\n\nunderscored that \u2018one thing\u2019!", "Margarita sighed again and said:\n\n\u2018I want them to stop giving Frieda that handkerchief with which she\n\nsmothered her baby.\u2019\n\nThe cat raised his eyes to heaven and sighed noisily, but said nothing,\n\nperhaps remembering how his ear had already suffered.", "\u2018In view of the fact,\u2019 said Woland, grinning, \u2018that the possibility of your\n\nhaving been bribed by that fool Frieda is, of course, entirely excluded -\n\nbeing incompatible with your royal dignity -

himself.", "\u2018Well, so, if it\u2019s more comforting, consider me that,\u2019 Woland replied\n\ncourteously.", "\u2018No, no!\u2019 Margarita said, frightened, shaking the master by the

Woland:\n\n\u2018Allow me to whisper something to him.\u2019\n\nWoland nodded his head, and Margarita, leaning to the master\u2019s ear,\n\nwhispered something to him.", "They heard him answer her.",

you,\u2019 Margarita answered and turned to Woland: \u2018I ask\n\nthat we be returned to the basement in the lane off the Arbat, and that the\n\nlamp be burning, and that everything be as it was.\u2019\n\nHere the master laughed and, embracing Margarita\u2019s long-since-uncurled\n\nhead, said:\n\n\u2018Ah, don\u2019t listen to the poor woman, Messire!", "Someone else has long\n\nbeen living in the basement, and generally it never happens that anything\n\ngoes back to what it used to be.\u2019 He put his cheek to his friend\u2019s head,\n\nembraced Margarita, and began muttering :

landlord gets surprised, tell him he dreamed\n\nAloisy up!", "Mogarych?", "What Mogarych?", "There was never any Mogarych!\u2019\n\nHere the loose-leafed book evaporated from Koroviev\u2019s hands.", "\u2018And there it\n\nis, already back in the landlord\u2019s desk.\u2019\n\n\u2018What you say is true,\u2019 the master observed, struck by the neatness of\n\nKoroviev\u2019s work, \u2018that if there are no papers, there\u2019s no person.", "I have no\n\npapers, so there\u2019s precisely no me.\u2019\n\n\u2018I beg your pardon,\u2019 Koroviev exclaimed, \u2018but that precisely is a\n\nhallucination, your papers are right here.\u2019 And Koroviev handed the master\n\nhis papers.", "Then he rolled up his eyes and whispered sweetly to Margarita:\n\n\u2018And here is your property, Margarita Nikolaevna,\u2019 and Koroviev handed\n\nMargarita the notebook with charred edges, the dried rose, the photograph,\n\nand, with particular care, the savings book.", "\u2018Ten

"\u2018What, dear donna, will you order me to do with your retinue?", "I personally\n\ndon\u2019t need them.\u2019\n\nHere the naked Natasha ran through the open door, clasped her hands,\n\nand cried out to Margarita:\n\n\u2018Be happy, Margarita Nikolaevna!\u2019 She nodded to the master and again\n\nturned to Margarita: \u2018I knew all about where you used to go.\u2019\n\n\u2018Domestics know everything,\u2019 observed the cat, raising a paw\n\nsignificantly.", "\u2018It\u2019s a mistake to think they\u2019re blind.\u2019\n\n\u2018What do you want, Natasha?\u2019 asked Margarita.",

is someone I shall dismiss with special pleasure,\u2019 said Woland,\n\nlooking at Nikolai Ivanovich with disgust, \u2018with exceptional pleasure, so\n\nsuperfluous he is here.\u2019\n\n\u2018I earnestly beg that you issue me a certificate,\u2019 Nikolai Ivanovich began\n\nwith great insistence, but looking around wildly, \u2018as to where I spent last\n\nnight.\u2019\n\n\u2018For what purpose?\u2019 the cat asked sternly.", "\u2018For the purpose of presenting it to the police and to my wife,\u2019 Nikolai\n\nIvanovich said firmly.", "\u2018We normally don\u2019t issue

sitting at a typewriter and the cat was dictating to her.", "\u2018It is hereby certified that the bearer, Nikolai Ivanovich, spent the said\n\nnight at Satan\u2019s ball, having been summoned there

Ivanovich.", "\u2018We don\u2019t put dates, with a date the document becomes invalid,\u2019\n\nresponded the cat, setting his scrawl to it.", "Then he got himself a stamp from\n\nsomewhere, breathed on it according to all the rules, stamped the word\n\n\u2018payed\u2019 on the paper, and handed it to Nikolai Ivanovich.", "After which\n\nNikolai Ivanovich disappeared without a trace, and in his

raving!\u2019 Woland said with a wince.", "\u2018Which Rimsky?", "What is this nonsense?\u2019\n\n\u2018Kindly do not worry, Messire,\u2019 responded Azazello, and he turned to\n\nVarenukha:

his face beamed,\n\nand, not knowing what he was saying, he began to murmur:\n\n\u2018Verily... that is, I mean to say ...", "Your ma ... right after dinner ...\u2019\n\nVarenukha pressed his hands to his chest, looking beseechingly at Azazello.", "\u2018All right.", "Home with you!\u2019 the latter said, and Varenukha dissolved.", "\u2018Now all of you leave me alone with them,\u2019 ordered

"And who is going to write?", "And the\n\ndreams, the inspiration?\u2019\n\n\u2018I have no more dreams, or inspiration either,\u2019 replied the master.", "\u2018No one\n\naround me interests me,

white, naked woman with a drooping head, afraid of\n\nappearing before the procurator\u2019s eyes at the wrong time, and at the same\n\ntime fearing to miss the moment when the procurator might call for him.", "Lying on the couch in the storm\u2019s twilight, the procurator poured wine\n\ninto the cup himself, drank it in long draughts, occasionally touched the\n\nbread, crumbled it, swallowed small pieces, sucked out an oyster from time\n\nto time, chewed a lemon, and drank again.", "Had it not been for the roaring of the water, had it not been for the\n\nthunderclaps that seemed to threaten to lay flat the roof of the palace, had it\n\nnot been for the rattle of hail hammering on the steps of the balcony, one\n\nmight have heard that the procurator was muttering something, talking to\n\nhimself.", "And if the unsteady glimmering of the heavenly fire had turned\n\ninto a constant light, an observer would have been able to see that the\n\nprocurator\u2019s face, with eyes inflamed by recent insomnia and wine, showed\n\nimpatience, that the procurator was not only looking at the two white roses\n\ndrowned in the red puddle, but constantly turned his face towards the\n\ngarden, meeting the watery spray and sand, that he was waiting for\n\nsomeone, impatiently waiting.", "Time passed, and the veil of water before the procurator\u2019s eyes began to\n\nthin.", "Furious as it was, the hurricane was weakening.", "Branches no longer\n\ncracked and fell.", "The thunderclaps and flashes came less frequently.", "It was\n\nno longer a violet coverlet trimmed with white, but an ordinary, grey rear-\n\nguard cloud that floated over Yershalaim.", "The storm was being swept\n\ntowards the Dead Sea.", "Now it was possible to hear separately the noise of the rain and the noise\n\nof water rushing along the gutters and also straight down the steps of that\n\nstairway upon which the procurator had walked in the afternoon to\n\nannounce the sentence in the square.", "And finally the hitherto drowned-out\n\nfountain made itself heard.", "It was growing lighter.", "Blue windows appeared\n\nin the grey veil fleeing eastward.", "Here, from far off, breaking through the patter of the now quite weakened\n\nrainfall, there came to the procurator\u2019s ears a weak sound of trumpets and\n\nthe tapping of several hundred hoofs.", "Hearing this, the procurator stirred,\n\nand his face livened up.", "The ala was coming back from Bald Mountain.", "Judging by the sound, it was passing through the same square where the\n\nsentence had been announced.", "At last the procurator heard the long-awaited footsteps and a slapping on\n\nthe stairs leading to the upper terrace of the garden, just in front of the\n\nbalcony.", "The procurator stretched his neck and his eyes glinted with an\n\nexpression of joy.", "Between the two marble lions there appeared first a hooded head, then a\n\ncompletely drenched man with his cloak clinging to his body.", "It was the\n\nsame man who had exchanged whispers with the procurator in a darkened\n\nroom of the palace before the sentencing, and who during the execution had\n\nsat on a three-legged stool playing with a twig.", "Heedless of puddles, the man in the hood crossed the garden terrace,\n\nstepped on to the mosaic floor of the balcony, and, raising his arm, said in a\n\nhigh, pleasant voice:\n\n\u2018Health and joy to the procurator!\u2019 The visitor spoke in Latin.", "\u2018Gods!\u2019 exclaimed Pilate.", "There\u2019s not a dry stitch on you!", "What a\n\nhurricane!", "Eh?", "I beg you to go inside immediately.", "Do me a favour and\n\nchange your clothes.\u2018\n\nThe visitor threw back his hood, revealing a completely wet head with\n\nhair plastered to the forehead, and, showing a polite smile on his clean-\n\nshaven face, began refusing to change, insisting that a little rain would not\n\nhurt him.", "\u2018I won\u2019t hear of it,\u2019 Pilate replied and clapped his hands.", "With that he\n\ncalled out the servants who were hiding from him, and told them to take\n\ncare of the visitor and then serve the hot course immediately.", "The procurator\u2019s visitor required very little time to dry his hair, change\n\nhis clothes and shoes, and generally put himself in order, and he soon\n\nappeared on the balcony in dry sandals, a dry crimson military cloak, and\n\nwith slicked-down hair.", "Just then the sun returned to Yershalaim, and, before going to drown in\n\nthe Mediterranean Sea, sent farewell rays to the city hated by the procurator\n\nand gilded the steps of the balcony.", "The fountain revived completely and\n\nsang away with all its might, doves came out on the sand, cooing, hopping\n\nover broken branches, pecking at something in the wet sand.", "The red puddle\n\nwas wiped up, the broken pieces were removed, meat steamed on the table.", "\u2018I wait to hear the procurator\u2019s orders,\u2019 said the visitor, approaching the\n\ntable.", "\u2018But you won\u2019t hear anything until you sit down and drink some wine,\u2019\n\nPilate replied courteously and pointed to the other couch.", "The visitor reclined, a servant poured some thick red wine into his cup.", "Another servant, leaning cautiously over Pilate\u2019s shoulder, filled the\n\nprocurator\u2019s cup.", "After that, he motioned for the two servants to withdraw.", "While the visitor drank and ate, Pilate, sipping his wine, kept glancing\n\nwith narrowed eyes at his guest.", "The man who had come to Pilate was\n\nmiddle-aged, with a very pleasant, rounded and neat face and a fleshy\n\nmouth.", "His hair was of some indeterminate colour.", "Now, as it dried, it\n\nbecame lighter.", "It would be difficult to establish the man\u2019s nationality.", "The\n\nchief determinant of his face was perhaps its good-natured expression,\n\nwhich, however, was not in accord with his eyes, or, rather, not his eyes but\n\nthe visitor\u2019s way of looking at his interlocutor.", "Ordinarily he kept his small\n\neyes under his lowered, somewhat strange, as if slightly swollen eyelids.", "Then the slits of these eyes shone with an unspiteful slyness.", "It must be\n\nsupposed that the procurator\u2019s guest had a propensity for humour.", "But\n\noccasionally, driving this glittering humour from the slits entirely, the\n\nprocurator\u2019s present guest would open his eyelids wide and look at his\n\ninterlocutor suddenly and point-blank, as if with the purpose of rapidly\n\nscrutinizing some inconspicuous spot on his interlocutor\u2019s nose.", "This lasted\n\nonly an instant, after which the eyelids would lower again, the slits would\n\nnarrow, and once again they would begin to shine with good-naturedness\n\nand sly intelligence.", "The visitor did not decline a second cup of wine, swallowed a few\n\noysters with obvious pleasure, tried some steamed vegetables, ate a piece of\n\nmeat.", "Having eaten his fill, he praised the wine:\n\n\u2018An excellent vintage, Procurator, but it is not Falerno?\u20191\n\n\u2018Caecuba,2 thirty years old,\u2019 the procurator replied courteously.", "The guest put his hand to his heart, declined to eat more, declared that he\n\nwas full.", "Then Pilate filled his own cup, and the guest did the same.", "Both\n\ndiners poured some wine from their cups on to the meat platter, and the\n\nprocurator, raising his cup, said loudly:\n\n\u2018For us, for thee, Caesar, father of the Romans, best and dearest of men!", "...\u2019\n\nAfter this they finished the wine, and the Africans removed the food from\n\nthe table, leaving the fruit and the jugs.", "Again the procurator motioned for\n\nthe servants to withdraw and remained alone with his guest under the\n\ncolonnade.", "\u2018And so,\u2019 Pilate began in a low voice, \u2018what can you tell me about the\n\nmood of this city?\u2019\n\nHe inadvertently turned his eyes to where the colonnades and flat roofs\n\nbelow, beyond the terraces of the garden, were drying out, gilded by the last\n\nrays.", "\u2018I believe, Procurator,\u2019 the guest replied, \u2018that the mood of Yershalaim is\n\nnow satisfactory.\u2019\n\n\u2018So it can be guaranteed that there is no threat of further disorders?\u2019\n\n\u2018Only one thing can be guaranteed in this world,\u2019 the guest replied,\n\nglancing tenderly at the procurator, \u2018the power of great Caesar.\u2019\n\n\u2018May the gods grant him long life!\u2019 Pilate picked up at once, \u2018and\n\nuniversal peace!\u2019 He paused and then continued: \u2018So you believe the troops\n\ncan now be withdrawn?\u2019\n\n\u2018I believe that the cohort of the Lightning legion can go,\u2019 the guest\n\nreplied and added: \u2018It would be good if it paraded through the city in\n\nfarewell.\u2019\n\n\u2018A very good thought,\u2019 the procurator approved, \u2018I will dismiss it the day\n\nafter tomorrow, and go myself, and \u2014 I swear to you by the feast of the\n\ntwelve gods, 3 by the lares4 I swear - I\u2019d give a lot to be able to do so today!\u2019\n\n\u2018The procurator doesn\u2019t like Yershalaim?\u2019 the guest asked good-\n\nnaturedly.", "\u2018Good heavens,\u2019 the procurator exclaimed, smiling, \u2018there\u2019s no more\n\nhopeless place on earth.", "I\u2019m not even speaking of natural conditions \u2014 I\n\nget sick every time I have to come here - but that\u2019s only half the trouble!", "...", "But these feasts!", "... Magicians, sorcerers, wizards, these flocks of pilgrims!", "...", "Fanatics, fanatics!", "... Just take this messiah5 they suddenly started\n\nexpecting this year!", "Every moment you think you\u2019re about to witness the\n\nmost unpleasant bloodshed ...", "The shifting of troops all the time, reading\n\ndenunciations and calumnies, half of which, moreover, are written against\n\nyourself!", "You must agree, it\u2019s boring.", "Oh, if it weren\u2019t for the imperial\n\nservice!\u2019\n\n\u2018Yes, the feasts are hard here,\u2019 agreed the guest.", "\u2018I wish with all my heart that they should be over soon,\u2019 Pilate added\n\nenergetically.", "\u2018I will finally have the possibility of going back to Caesarea.", "Believe me, this delirious construction of Herod\u2019s\u2019 \u2014 the procurator waved\n\nhis arm along the colonnade, to make clear that he was speaking of the\n\npalace \u2014 \u2018positively drives me out of my mind!", "I cannot spend my nights\n\nin it.", "The world has never known a stranger architecture!", "... Well, but let\u2019s\n\nget back to business.", "First of all, this cursed Bar-Rabban \u2014 you\u2019re not\n\nworried about him?\u2019\n\nAnd here the guest sent his peculiar glance at the procurator\u2019s cheek.", "But\n\nthe latter, frowning squeamishly, gazed into the distance with bored eyes,\n\ncontemplating the part of the city that lay at his feet and was fading into the\n\ntwilight.", "The guest\u2019s eyes also faded, and his eyelids lowered.", "\u2018It may be supposed that Bar has now become as harmless as a lamb,\u2019 the\n\nguest began to say, and wrinkles appeared on his round face.", "\u2018It would be\n\nawkward for him to rebel now.\u2019\n\n\u2018Too famous?\u2019 Pilate asked with a smirk.", "\u2018The procurator has subtly understood the problem, as always.\u2019\n\n\u2018But in any case,\u2019 the procurator observed with concern, and the thin,\n\nlong finger with the black stone of its ring was raised, \u2018there must be...\u2019\n\n\u2018Oh, the procurator can be certain that as long as I am in Judea, Bar will\n\nnot take a step without having someone on his heels.\u2019\n\n\u2018Now I am at peace \u2014 as I always am, incidentally, when you are here.\u2019\n\nThe procurator is too kind!\u2018\n\n\u2018And now I ask you to tell me about the execution,\u2019 said the procurator.", "\u2018What precisely interests the procurator?\u2019\n\n\u2018Were there any attempts on the part of the crowd to display\n\nrebelliousness?", "That is the main thing, of course.\u2019\n\n\u2018None,\u2019 replied the guest.", "\u2018Very good.", "Did you personally establish that death took place?\u2019\n\nThe procurator may be certain of it.\u2018\n\n\u2018And tell me ... were they given the drink before being hung on the\n\nposts?\u20196\n\n\u2018Yes.", "But he,\u2019 here the guest closed his eyes, \u2018refused to drink it.\u2019\n\n\u2018Who, precisely?\u2019 asked Pilate.", "\u2018Forgive me, Hegemon!\u2019 the guest exclaimed.", "\u2018Did I not name him?", "Ha-\n\nNozri!\u2019\n\n\u2018Madman!\u2019 said Pilate, grimacing for some reason.", "A little nerve began\n\nto twitch under his left eye.", "\u2018To die of sunburn!", "Why refuse what is offered\n\nby law!", "In what terms did he refuse it?\u2019\n\n\u2018He said,\u2019 the guest answered, again closing his eyes, \u2018that he was\n\ngrateful and laid no blame for the taking of his life.\u2019\n\n\u2018On whom?\u2019 Pilate asked in a hollow voice.", "That he did not say, Hegemon ...\u2018\n\n\u2018Did he try to preach anything in the soldiers\u2019 presence?\u2019\n\n\u2018No, Hegemon, he was not loquacious this time.", "The only thing he said\n\nwas that among human vices he considered cowardice one of the first.\u20197\n\nThis was said with regard to what?\u2018 the guest heard a suddenly cracked\n\nvoice.", "That was impossible to understand.", "He generally behaved himself\n\nstrangely \u2014 as always, however.\u2018\n\n\u2018What was this strangeness?\u2019\n\n\u2018He kept trying to peer into the eyes of one or another of those around\n\nhim, and kept smiling some sort of lost smile.\u2019\n\n\u2018Nothing else?\u2019 asked the hoarse voice.", "\u2018Nothing else.\u2019\n\nThe procurator knocked against the cup as he poured himself some wine.", "After draining it to the very bottom, he spoke:\n\n\u2018The matter consists in the following: though we have been unable \u2014 so\n\nfar at least - to discover any admirers or followers of his, it is none the less\n\nimpossible to guarantee that there are none.\u2019\n\nThe guest listened attentively, inclining his head.", "\u2018And so, to avoid surprises of any sort,\u2019 the procurator continued, \u2018I ask\n\nyou to remove the bodies of all three executed men from the face of the\n\nearth, immediately and without any noise, and to bury them in secrecy and\n\nsilence, so that not another word or whisper is heard of them.\u2019\n\n\u2018Understood, Hegemon,\u2019 replied the guest, and he got up, saying: \u2018In\n\nview of the complexity and responsibility of the matter, allow me to go\n\nimmediately.\u2019\n\n\u2018No, sit down again,\u2019 said Pilate, stopping his guest with a gesture, \u2018there\n\nare two more questions.", "First, your enormous merits in this most difficult\n\njob at the post of head of the secret service for the procurator of Judea give\n\nme the pleasant opportunity of reporting them to Rome.\u2019\n\nHere the guest\u2019s face turned pink, he rose and bowed to the procurator,\n\nsaying:\n\n\u2018I merely fulfil my duty in the imperial service.\u2019\n\n\u2018But I wanted to ask you,\u2019 the hegemon continued, \u2018in case you\u2019re\n\noffered a transfer elsewhere with a raise \u2014 to decline it and remain here.", "I\n\nwouldn\u2019t want to part with you for anything.", "Let them reward you in some\n\nother way.\u2019\n\n\u2018I am happy to serve under your command, Hegemon.\u2019\n\n\u2018That pleases me very much.", "And so, the second question.", "It concerns\n\nthis ... what\u2019s his name ... Judas of Kiriath.\u2019\n\nHere the guest sent the procurator his glance, and at once, as was his\n\ncustom, extinguished it.", "\u2018They say,\u2019 the procurator continued, lowering his voice, \u2018that he\n\nsupposedly got some money for receiving this madman so cordially?\u2019\n\n\u2018Will get,\u2019 the head of the secret service quietly corrected Pilate.", "\u2018And is it a large sum?\u2019\n\n\u2018That no one can say, Hegemon.\u2019\n\n\u2018Not even you?\u2019 said the hegemon, expressing praise by his amazement.", "\u2018Alas, not even I,\u2019 the guest calmly replied.", "\u2018But he will get the money\n\nthis evening, that I do know.", "He is to be summoned tonight to the palace of\n\nKaifa.\u2019\n\n\u2018Ah, that greedy old man of Kiriath!\u2019 the procurator observed, smiling.", "\u2018He is an old man, isn\u2019t he?\u2019\n\n\u2018The procurator is never mistaken, but he is mistaken this time,\u2019 the guest\n\nreplied courteously, \u2018the man from Kiriath is a young man.\u2019\n\n\u2018You don\u2019t say!", "Can you describe his character for me?", "A fanatic?\u2019\n\n\u2018Oh, no, Procurator.\u2019\n\n\u2018So.", "And anything else?\u2019\n\n\u2018Very handsome.\u2019\n\n\u2018What else?", "He has some passion, perhaps?\u2019\n\n\u2018It is difficult to have such precise knowledge about everyone in this\n\nhuge city, Procurator ...\u2019\n\n\u2018Ah, no, no, Aphranius!", "Don\u2019t play down your merits.\u2019\n\n\u2018He has one passion, Procurator.\u2019 The guest made a tiny pause.", "\u2018A\n\npassion for money.\u2019\n\n\u2018And what is his occupation?\u2019\n\nAphranius raised his eyes, thought, and replied:\n\n\u2018He works in the money-changing shop of one of his relatives.\u2019\n\n\u2018Ah, so, so, so, so.\u2019 Here the procurator fell silent, looked around to be\n\nsure there was no one on the balcony, and then said quietly: \u2018The thing is\n\nthis \u2014 I have just received information that he is going to be killed tonight.\u2019\n\nThis time the guest not only cast his glance at the procurator, but even\n\nheld it briefly, and after that replied:\n\n\u2018You spoke too flatteringly of me, Procurator.", "In my opinion, I do not\n\ndeserve your report.", "This information I do not have.\u2019\n\n\u2018You deserve the highest reward,\u2019 the procurator replied.", "\u2018But there is\n\nsuch information.\u2019\n\n\u2018May I be so bold as to ask who supplied it?\u2019\n\n\u2018Permit me not to say for the time being, the more so as it is accidental,\n\nobscure and uncertain.", "But it is my duty to foresee everything.", "That is my\n\njob, and most of all I must trust my presentiment, for it has never yet\n\ndeceived me.", "The information is that one of Ha-Nozri\u2019s secret friends,\n\nindignant at this money-changer\u2019s monstrous betrayal, is plotting with his\n\naccomplices to kill him tonight, and to foist the money paid for the betrayal\n\non the high priest, with a note: \u201cI return the cursed money.\u201d\u2019 The head of\n\nthe secret service cast no more of his unexpected glances at the hegemon,\n\nbut went on listening to him, narrowing his eyes, as Pilate went on:\n\n\u2018Imagine, is it going to be pleasant for the high priest to receive such a\n\ngift on the night of the feast?\u2019\n\n\u2018Not only not pleasant,\u2019 the guest replied, smiling, \u2018but I believe,\n\nProcurator, that it will cause a very great scandal.\u2019\n\n\u2018I am of the same opinion myself.", "And therefore I ask you to occupy\n\nyourself with this matter - that is, to take all measures to protect Judas of\n\nKiriath.\u2019\n\nThe hegemon\u2019s order will be carried out,\u2018 said Aphranius, \u2019but I must\n\nreassure the hegemon: the evil-doers\u2019 plot is very hard to bring off.", "Only\n\nthink,\u2018 the guest looked over his shoulder as he spoke and went on, \u2019to track\n\nthe man down, to kill him, and besides that to find out how much he got,\n\nand manage to return the money to Kaifa, and all that in one night?", "Tonight?\u2018\n\n\u2018And none the less he will be killed tonight,\u2019 Pilate stubbornly repeated.", "\u2018I have a presentiment, I tell you!", "Never once has it deceived me.\u2019 Here a\n\nspasm passed over the procurator\u2019s face, and he rubbed his hands briskly.", "\u2018Understood,\u2019 the guest obediently replied, stood up, straightened out,\n\nand suddenly asked sternly: \u2018So they will kill him, Hegemon?\u2019\n\n\u2018Yes,\u2019 answered Pilate, \u2018and all hope lies in your efficiency alone, which\n\n\n\n\n\namazes everyone.\u2019\n\nThe guest adjusted the heavy belt under his cloak and said:\n\n\u2018I salute you and wish you health and joy!\u2019\n\n\u2018Ah, yes,\u2019 Pilate exclaimed softly, \u2018I completely forgot!", "I owe you\n\nsomething!", "...\u2019\n\nThe guest was amazed.", "\u2018Really, Procurator, you owe me nothing.\u2019\n\n\u2018But of course!", "As I was riding into Yershalaim, remember, the crowd of\n\nbeggars ...", "I wanted to throw them some money, but I didn\u2019t have any, and\n\nso I took it from you.\u2019\n\n\u2018Oh, Procurator, it was a trifle!\u2019\n\n\u2018One ought to remember trifles, too.\u2019 Here Pilate turned, picked up the\n\ncloak that lay on the chair behind him, took a leather bag from under it, and\n\nhanded it to the guest.", "The man bowed, accepting it, and put the bag under\n\nhis cloak.", "\u2018I expect a report on the burial,\u2019 said Pilate, \u2018and also on the matter to do\n\nwith Judas of Kiriath, this same night, do you hear, Aphranius, this night.", "The convoy will have orders to awaken me the moment you appear.", "I\u2019ll be\n\nexpecting you.\u2019\n\n\u2018I salute you,\u2019 the head of the secret service said and, turning, left the\n\nbalcony.", "One could hear the wet sand crunch under his feet, then the stamp\n\nof his boots on the marble between the lions, then his legs were cut off, then\n\nhis body, and finally the hood also disappeared.", "Only here did the\n\nprocurator notice that the sun was gone and twilight had come.", "CHAPTER 26\n\nThe Burial\n\nAnd perhaps it was the twilight that caused such a sharp change in the\n\nprocurator\u2019s appearance.", "He aged, grew hunched as if before one\u2019s eyes,\n\nand, besides that, became alarmed.", "Once he looked around and gave a start\n\nfor some reason, casting an eye on the empty chair with the cloak thrown\n\nover its back.", "The night of the feast was approaching, the evening shadows\n\nplayed their game, and the tired procurator probably imagined that someone\n\nwas sitting in the empty chair.", "Yielding to his faint-heartedness and ruffling\n\nthe cloak, the procurator let it drop and began rushing about the balcony,\n\nnow rubbing his hands, now rushing to the table and seizing the cup, now\n\nstopping and staring senselessly at the mosaics of the floor, as if trying to\n\nread something written there ...", "It was the second time in the same day that anguish came over him.", "Rubbing his temple, where only a dull, slightly aching reminder of the\n\nmorning\u2019s infernal pain lingered, the procurator strained to understand what\n\nthe reason for his soul\u2019s torments was.", "And he quickly understood it, but\n\nattempted to deceive himself.", "It was clear to him that that afternoon he had\n\nlost something irretrievably, and that he now wanted to make up for the loss\n\nby some petty, worthless and, above all, belated actions.", "The deceiving of\n\nhimself consisted in the procurator\u2019s trying to convince himself that these\n\nactions, now, this evening, were no less important than the morning\u2019s\n\nsentence.", "But in this the procurator succeeded very poorly.", "At one of his turns, he stopped abruptly and whistled.", "In response to this\n\nwhistle, a low barking resounded in the twilight, and a gigantic sharp-eared\n\ndog with a grey pelt and a gold-studded collar sprang from the garden on to\n\nthe balcony.", "\u2018Banga, Banga,\u2019 the procurator cried weakly.", "The dog rose on his hind legs, placed his front paws on his master\u2019s\n\nshoulders, nearly knocking him to the floor, and licked his cheek.", "The\n\nprocurator sat down in the armchair.", "Banga, his tongue hanging out, panting\n\nheavily, lay down at his master\u2019s feet, and the joy in the dog\u2019s eyes meant\n\nthat the storm was over, the only thing in the world that the fearless dog was\n\nafraid of, and also that he was again there, next to the man whom he loved,\n\nrespected, and considered the most powerful man in the world, the ruler of\n\nall men, thanks to whom the dog considered himself a privileged, lofty and\n\nspecial being.", "Lying down at his master\u2019s feet without even looking at him,\n\nbut looking into the dusky garden, the dog nevertheless realized at once that\n\ntrouble had befallen his master.", "He therefore changed his position, got up,\n\ncame from the side and placed his front paws and head on the procurator\u2019s\n\nknees, smearing the bottom of his cloak with wet sand.", "Banga\u2019s actions\n\nwere probably meant to signify that he comforted his master and was ready\n\nto meet misfortune with him.", "He also attempted to express this with his\n\neyes, casting sidelong glances at his master, and with his alert, pricked-up\n\nears.", "Thus the two of them, the dog and man who loved each other, met the\n\nnight of the feast on the balcony.", "Just then the procurator\u2019s guest was in the midst of a great bustle.", "After\n\nleaving the upper terrace of the garden before the balcony, he went down\n\nthe stairs to the next terrace of the garden, turned right and came to the\n\nbarracks which stood on the palace grounds.", "In these barracks the two\n\ncenturies that had come with the procurator for the feast in Yershalaim were\n\nquartered, as was the procurator\u2019s secret guard, which was under the\n\ncommand of this very guest.", "The guest did not spend much time in the\n\nbarracks, no more than ten minutes, but at the end of these ten minutes,\n\nthree carts drove out of the barracks yard loaded with entrenching tools and\n\na barrel of water.", "The carts were escorted by fifteen mounted men in grey\n\ncloaks.", "Under their escort the carts left the palace grounds by the rear gate,\n\nturned west, drove through gates in the city wall, and followed a path first\n\nto the Bethlehem road, then down this road to the north, came to the\n\nintersection by the Hebron gate, and then moved down the Jaffa road, along\n\nwhich the procession had gone during the day with the men condemned to\n\ndeath.", "By that time it was already dark, and the moon appeared on the\n\nhorizon.", "Soon after the departure of the carts with their escorting detachment, the\n\nprocurator\u2019s guest also left the palace grounds on horseback, having\n\nchanged into a dark, worn chiton.", "The guest went not out of the city but into\n\nit.", "Some time later he could be seen approaching the Antonia Fortress,\n\nlocated to the north and in the vicinity of the great temple.", "The guest did not\n\nspend much time in the fortress either, and then his tracks turned up in the\n\nLower City, in its crooked and tangled streets.", "Here the guest now came\n\nriding a mule.", "Knowing the city well, the guest easily found the street he wanted.", "It was\n\ncalled Greek Street, because there were several Greek shops on it, among\n\nthem one that sold carpets.", "Precisely by this shop, the guest stopped his\n\nmule, dismounted, and tied it to the ring by the gate.", "The shop was closed\n\nby then.", "The guest walked through the little gate beside the entrance to the\n\nshop and found himself in a small square courtyard surrounded on three\n\nsides by sheds.", "Turning a comer inside the yard, the guest came to the stone\n\nterrace of a house all twined with ivy and looked around.", "Both the little\n\nhouse and the sheds were dark, no lamps were lit yet.", "The guest called\n\nsoftly:\n\n\u2018Niza!\u2019\n\nAt this call a door creaked, and in the evening twilight a young woman\n\nwithout a veil appeared on the terrace.", "She leaned over the railing, peering\n\nanxiously, wishing to know who had come.", "Recognizing the visitor, she\n\nsmiled amiably to him, nodded her head, waved her hand.", "\u2018Are you alone?\u2019 Aphranius asked softly in Greek.", "\u2018Yes,\u2019 the woman on the terrace whispered, \u2018my husband left for\n\nCaesarea in the morning.\u2019 Here the woman looked back at the door and\n\nadded in a whisper: \u2018But the serving-woman is at home.\u2019 Here she made a\n\ngesture meaning \u2018Come in\u2019.", "Aphranius looked around and went up the stone steps.", "After which both\n\nhe and the woman disappeared into the house.", "With this woman Aphranius\n\nspent very little time, certainly no more than five minutes.", "After which he\n\nleft the house and the terrace, pulled the hood down lower on his eyes, and\n\nwent out to the street.", "Just then the lamps were being lit in the houses, the\n\npre-festive tumult was still considerable, and Aphranius on his mule lost\n\nhimself in the stream of riders and passers-by.", "His subsequent route is not\n\nknown to anyone.", "The woman Aphranius called \u2018Niza\u2019, left alone, began changing her\n\nclothes, and was hurrying greatly.", "But difficult though it was for her to find\n\nthe things she needed in the dark room, she did not light a lamp or call the\n\nserving-woman.", "Only after she was ready and her head was covered by a\n\ndark veil did the sound of her voice break the silence in the little house:\n\n\u2018If anyone asks for me, say I went to visit Enanta.\u2019\n\nThe old serving-woman\u2019s grumbling was heard in the darkness:\n\n\u2018Enanta?", "Ah, this Enanta!", "Didn\u2019t your husband forbid you to visit her?", "She\u2019s a procuress, your Enanta!", "Wait till I tell your husband...\u2019\n\n\u2018Well, well, be quiet,\u2019 Niza replied and, like a shadow, slipped out of the\n\nhouse.", "Niza\u2019s sandals pattered over the stone flags of the yard.", "The serving-\n\nwoman, grumbling, shut the door to the terrace.", "Niza left her house.", "Just at that time, from another lane in the Lower City, a twisting lane that\n\nran down from ledge to ledge to one of the city pools, from the gates of an\n\nunsightly house with a blank wall looking on to the lane and windows on\n\nthe courtyard, came a young man with a neatly trimmed beard, wearing a\n\nwhite kefia falling to his shoulders, a new pale blue festive tallith with\n\ntassels at the bottom, and creaking new sandals.", "The handsome, aquiline-\n\nnosed young fellow, all dressed up for the great feast, walked briskly,\n\ngetting ahead of passers-by hurrying home for the solemn meal, and\n\nwatched as one window after another lit up.", "The young man took the street\n\nleading past the bazaar to the palace of the high priest Kaifa, located at the\n\nfoot of the temple hill.", "Some time later he could be seen entering the gates of Kaifa\u2019s courtyard.", "And a bit later still, leaving the same courtyard.", "After visiting the palace, where the lamps and torches already blazed, and\n\nwhere the festive bustle had already begun, the young man started walking\n\nstill more briskly, still more joyfully, hastening back to the Lower City.", "At\n\nthe comer where the street flowed into the market-place, amidst the\n\nseething and tumult, he was overtaken by a slight woman, walking with a\n\ndancer\u2019s gait, in a black veil that came down over her eyes.", "As she overtook\n\nthe handsome young man, this woman raised her veil for a moment, cast a\n\nglance in the young man\u2019s direction, yet not only did not slow her pace, but\n\nquickened it, as if trying to escape from the one she had overtaken.", "The young man not only noticed this woman, no, he also recognized her,\n\nand, having recognized her, gave a start, halted, looking perplexedly into\n\nher back, and at once set out after her.", "Almost knocking over some passer-\n\nby carrying a jug, the young man caught up with the woman, and, breathing\n\nheavily with agitation, called out to her:\n\n\u2018Niza!\u2019\n\nThe woman turned, narrowed her eyes, her face showing cold vexation,\n\nand replied drily in Greek:\n\n\u2018Ah, it\u2019s you, Judas?", "I didn\u2019t recognize you at once.", "That\u2019s good, though.", "With us, if someone\u2019s not recognized, it\u2019s a sign he\u2019ll get rich...\u2019\n\nSo agitated that his heart started leaping like a bird under a black cloth,\n\nJudas asked in a faltering whisper, for fear passers-by might overhear:\n\n\u2018Where are you going, Niza?\u2019\n\n\u2018And what do you want to know that for?\u2019 replied Niza, slowing her pace\n\nand looking haughtily at Judas.", "Then some sort of childish intonations began to sound in Judas\u2019s voice,\n\nhe whispered in bewilderment:\n\n\u2018But why?", "... We had it all arranged ...", "I wanted to come to you, you said\n\nyou\u2019d be home all evening ...\u2019\n\n\u2018Ah, no, no,\u2019 answered Niza, and she pouted her lower lip capriciously,\n\nwhich made it seem to Judas that her face, the most beautiful face he had\n\never seen in his life, became still more beautiful.", "\u2018I was bored.", "You\u2019re\n\nhaving a feast, and what am I supposed to do?", "Sit and listen to you sighing\n\non the terrace?", "And be afraid, on top of it, that the serving-woman will tell\n\nhim about it?", "No, no, I decided to go out of town and listen to the\n\nnightingales.\u2019\n\n\u2018How, out of town?\u2019 the bewildered Judas asked.", "\u2018Alone?\u2019\n\n\u2018Of course, alone,\u2019 answered Niza.", "\u2018Let me accompany you,\u2019 Judas asked breathlessly.", "His mind clouded, he\n\nforgot everything in the world and looked with imploring eyes into the blue\n\neyes of Niza, which now seemed black.", "Niza said nothing and quickened her pace.", "\u2018Why are you silent, Niza?\u2019 Judas said pitifully, adjusting his pace to\n\nhers.", "\u2018Won\u2019t I be bored with you?\u2019 Niza suddenly asked and stopped.", "Here\n\nJudas\u2019s thoughts became totally confused.", "\u2018Well, all right,\u2019 Niza finally softened, \u2018come along.\u2019\n\n\u2018But where, where?\u2019\n\nWait ... let\u2019s go into this yard and arrange it, otherwise I\u2019m afraid some\n\nacquaintance will see me and then they\u2019ll tell my husband I was out with\n\nmy lover.\u2018\n\nAnd here Niza and Judas were no longer in the bazaar, they were\n\nwhispering under the gateway of some yard.", "\u2018Go to the olive estate,\u2019 Niza whispered, pulling the veil over her eyes\n\nand turning away from a man who was coming through the gateway with a\n\nbucket, \u2018to Gethsemane, beyond the Kedron, understand?\u2019\n\n\u2018Yes, yes, yes ...\u2019\n\n\u2018I\u2019ll go ahead,\u2019 Niza continued, \u2018but don\u2019t follow on my heels.", "Keep\n\nseparate from me.", "I\u2019ll go ahead ...", "When you cross the stream ... you know\n\nwhere the grotto is?\u2019\n\n\u2018I know, I know ...\u2019\n\n\u2018Go up past the olive press and turn to the grotto.", "I\u2019ll be there.", "Only don\u2019t\n\nyou dare come after me at once, be patient, wait here,\u2019 and with these words\n\nNiza walked out the gateway as though she had never spoken with Judas.", "Judas stood for some time alone, trying to collect his scattering thoughts.", "Among them was the thought of how he was going to explain his absence\n\nfrom the festal family meal.", "Judas stood thinking up some lie, but in his\n\nagitation was unable to think through or prepare anything properly, and\n\nslowly walked out the gateway.", "Now he changed his route, he was no longer heading towards the Lower\n\nCity, but turned back to Kaifa\u2019s palace.", "The feast had already entered the\n\ncity.", "In the windows around Judas, not only were lights shining, but hymns\n\nof praise were heard.", "On the pavement, belated passers-by urged their\n\ndonkeys on, whipping them up, shouting at them.", "Judas\u2019s legs carried him\n\nby themselves, and he did not notice how the terrible, mossy Antonia\n\nTowers flew past him, he did not hear the roar of trumpets in the fortress,\n\ndid not pay attention to the mounted Roman patrol and its torch that flooded\n\nhis path with an alarming light.", "Turning after he passed the tower, Judas saw that in the terrible height\n\nabove the temple two gigantic five-branched candlesticks blazed.", "But even\n\nthese Judas made out vaguely.", "It seemed to him that ten lamps of an\n\nunprecedented size lit up over Yershalaim, competing with the light of the\n\nsingle lamp that was rising ever higher over Yershalaim - the moon.", "Now Judas could not be bothered with anything, he headed for the\n\nGethsemane gate, he wanted to leave the city quickly.", "At times it seemed to\n\nhim that before him, among the backs and faces of passers-by, the dancing\n\nlittle figure flashed, leading him after her.", "But this was an illusion.", "Judas\n\nrealized that Niza was significantly ahead of him.", "Judas rushed past the\n\nmoney-changing shops and finally got to the Gethsemane gate.", "There,\n\nburning with impatience, he was still forced to wait.", "Camels were coming\n\ninto the city, and after them rode a Syrian military patrol, which Judas\n\ncursed mentally ...", "But all things come to an end.", "The impatient Judas was already beyond\n\nthe city wall.", "To the left of him Judas saw a small cemetery, next to it\n\nseveral striped pilgrims\u2019 tents.", "Crossing the dusty road flooded with\n\nmoonlight, Judas headed for the stream of the Kedron with the intention of\n\nwading across it.", "The water babbled quietly under Judas\u2019s feet.", "Jumping\n\nfrom stone to stone, he finally came out on the Gethsemane bank opposite\n\nand saw with great joy that here the road below the gardens was empty.", "The\n\nhalf-ruined gates of the olive estate could already be seen not far away.", "After the stuffy city, Judas was struck by the stupefying smell of the\n\nspring night.", "From the garden a wave of myrtle and acacia from the\n\nGethsemane glades poured over the fence.", "No one was guarding the gateway, there was no one in it, and a few\n\nminutes later Judas was already running under the mysterious shade of the\n\nenormous, spreading olive trees.", "The road went uphill.", "Judas ascended,\n\nbreathing heavily, at times emerging from the darkness on to patterned\n\ncarpets of moonlight, which reminded him of the carpets he had seen in the\n\nshop of Niza\u2019s jealous husband.", "A short time later there flashed at Judas\u2019s left hand, in a clearing, an alive\n\npress with a heavy stone wheel and a pile of barrels.", "There was no one in\n\nthe garden, work had ended at sunset, and now over Judas choirs of\n\nnightingales pealed and trilled.", "Judas\u2019s goal was near.", "He knew that on his right in the darkness he would\n\npresently begin to hear the soft whisper of water falling in the grotto.", "And\n\nso it happened, he heard it.", "It was getting cooler.", "Then he slowed his pace\n\nand called softly:\n\n\u2018Niza!\u2019\n\nBut instead of Niza, a stocky male figure, detaching itself from a thick\n\nolive trunk, leaped out on the road, and something gleamed in its hand and\n\nat once went out.", "With a weak cry, Judas rushed back, but a second man\n\nbarred his way.", "The first man, in front of him, asked Judas:\n\n\u2018How much did you just get?", "Speak, if you want to save your life!\u2019\n\nHope flared up in Judas\u2019s heart, and he cried out desperately:\n\n\u2018Thirty tetradrachmas!", "1 Thirty tetradrachmas!", "I have it all with me!", "Here\u2019s the money!", "Take it, but grant me my life!\u2018\n\nThe man in front instantly snatched the purse from Judas\u2019s hands.", "And at\n\nthe same instant a knife flew up behind Judas\u2019s back and struck the lover\n\nunder the shoulder-blade.", "Judas was flung forward and thrust out his hands\n\nwith clawed fingers into the air.", "The front man caught Judas on his knife\n\nand buried it up to the hilt in Judas\u2019s heart.", "\u2018Ni... za ...\u2019 Judas said, not in his own high and clear young voice, but in\n\na low and reproachful one, and uttered not another sound.", "His body struck\n\nthe earth so hard that it hummed.", "Then a third figure appeared on the road.", "This third one wore a cloak\n\nwith a hood.", "\u2018Don\u2019t linger,\u2019 he ordered.", "The killers quickly wrapped the purse together\n\nwith a note handed to them by the third man in a piece of hide and criss-\n\ncrossed it with twine.", "The second put the bundle into his bosom, and then\n\nthe two killers plunged off the roadsides and the darkness between the olive\n\ntrees ate them.", "The third squatted down by the murdered man and looked at\n\nhis face.", "In the darkness it appeared white as chalk to the gazing man and\n\nsomehow spiritually beautiful.", "A few seconds later there was not a living man on the road.", "The lifeless\n\nbody lay with outstretched arms.", "The left foot was in a spot of moonlight,\n\nso that each strap of the sandal could be seen distinctly.", "The whole garden\n\nof Gethsemane was just then pealing with the song of nightingales.", "Where the two who had stabbed Judas went, no one knows, but the route\n\nof the third man in the hood is known.", "Leaving the road, he headed into the\n\nthick of the olive trees, making his way south.", "He climbed over the garden\n\nfence far from the main gate, in the southern corner, where the upper stones\n\nof the masonry had fallen out.", "Soon he was on the bank of the Kedron.", "Then he entered the water and for some time made his way in it, until he\n\nsaw ahead the silhouettes of two horses and a man beside them.", "The horses\n\nwere also standing in the stream.", "The water flowed, washing their hoofs.", "The horse-handler mounted one of the horses, the man in the hood jumped\n\non to the other, and the two slowly walked in the stream, and one could hear\n\nthe pebbles crunching under the horses\u2019 hoofs.", "Then the riders left the\n\nwater, came out on the Yershalaim bank, and rode slowly under the city\n\nwall.", "Here the horse-handler separated himself, galloped ahead, and\n\ndisappeared from view, while the man in the hood stopped his horse,\n\ndismounted on the deserted road, removed his cloak, turned it inside out,\n\ntook from under the cloak a flat helmet without plumes and put it on.", "Now\n\nit was a man in a military chlamys with a short sword at his hip who\n\njumped on to the horse.", "He touched the reins and the fiery cavalry horse set\n\noff at a trot, jolting its rider.", "It was not a long way \u2014 the rider was\n\napproaching the southern gate of Yershalaim.", "Under the arch of the gateway the restless flame of torches danced and\n\nleaped.", "The soldiers on guard from the second century of the Lightning\n\nlegion sat on stone benches playing dice.", "Seeing a military man ride in, the\n\nsoldiers jumped up, the man waved his hand to them and rode on into the\n\ncity.", "The city was flooded with festive lights.", "The flames of lamps played in\n\nall the windows, and from everywhere, merging into one dissonant chorus,\n\ncame hymns of praise.", "Occasionally glancing into windows that looked on\n\nto the street, the rider could see people at tables set with roast kid and cups\n\nof wine amidst dishes of bitter herbs.", "Whistling some quiet song, the rider\n\nmade his way at an unhurried trot through the deserted streets of the Lower\n\nCity, heading for the Antonia Tower, glancing occasionally at the five-\n\nbranched candlesticks, such as the world had never seen, blazing above the\n\ntemple, or at the moon that hung still higher than the five-branched\n\ncandlesticks.", "The palace of Herod the Great took no part in the solemnities of the\n\nPassover night.", "In the auxiliary quarters of the palace, facing to the south,\n\nwhere the officers of the Roman cohort and the legate of the legion were\n\nstationed, lights burned and there was a feeling of some movement and life.", "But the front part, the formal part, which housed the sole and involuntary\n\noccupant of the palace - the procurator \u2014 all of it, with its columns and\n\ngolden statues, was as if blind under the brightest moon.", "Here, inside the\n\npalace, darkness and silence reigned.", "And the procurator, as he had told Aphranius, would not go inside.", "He\n\nordered his bed made up on the balcony, there where he had dined and\n\nwhere he had conducted the interrogation in the morning.", "The procurator\n\nlay on the made-up couch, but sleep would not come to him.", "The bare moon\n\nhung high in the clear sky, and the procurator did not take his eyes off it for\n\nseveral hours.", "Approximately at midnight, sleep finally took pity on the hegemon.", "With\n\na spasmodic yawn, the procurator unfastened and threw off his cloak,\n\nremoved the belt girded over his shirt, with a broad steel knife in a sheath,\n\nplaced it on the chair by his couch, took off his sandals, and stretched out.", "Banga got on the bed at once and lay down next to him, head to head, and\n\nthe procurator, placing his hand on the dog\u2019s neck, finally closed his eyes.", "Only then did the dog also fall asleep.", "The couch was in semi-darkness, shielded from the moon by a column,\n\nbut a ribbon of moonlight stretched from the porch steps to the bed.", "And\n\nonce the procurator lost connection with what surrounded him in reality, he\n\nimmediately set out on the shining road and went up it straight towards the\n\nmoon.", "He even burst out laughing in his sleep from happiness, so wonderful\n\nand inimitable did everything come to be on the transparent, pale blue road.", "He walked in the company of Banga, and beside him walked the wandering\n\nphilosopher.", "They were arguing about something very complex and\n\nimportant, and neither of them could refute the other.", "They did not agree\n\nwith each other in anything, and that made their argument especially\n\ninteresting and endless.", "It went without saying that today\u2019s execution\n\nproved to be a sheer misunderstanding: here this philosopher, who had\n\nthought up such an incredibly absurd thing as that all men are good, was\n\nwalking beside him, therefore he was alive.", "And, of course, it would be\n\nterrible even to think that one could execute such a man.", "There had been no\n\nexecution!", "No execution!", "That was the loveliness of this journey up the\n\nstairway of the moon.", "There was as much free time as they needed, and the storm would come\n\nonly towards evening, and cowardice was undoubtedly one of the most\n\nterrible vices.", "Thus spoke Yeshua Ha-Nozri.", "No, philosopher, I disagree\n\nwith you: it is the most terrible vice!", "He, for example, the present procurator of Judea and former tribune of a\n\nlegion, had been no coward that time, in the Valley of the Virgins, when the\n\nfierce Germani had almost torn Ratslayer the Giant to pieces.", "But, good\n\nheavens, philosopher!", "How can you, with your intelligence, allow yourself\n\nto think that, for the sake of a man who has committed a crime against\n\nCaesar, the procurator of Judea would ruin his career?", "\u2018Yes, yes ...\u2019 Pilate moaned and sobbed in his sleep.", "Of course he would.", "In the morning he still would not, but now, at night, after weighing\n\neverything, he would agree to ruin it.", "He would do everything to save the\n\ndecidedly innocent, mad dreamer and healer from execution!", "\u2018Now we shall always be together,\u20192 said the ragged wandering\n\nphilosopher in his dream, who for some unknown reason had crossed paths\n\nwith the equestrian of the golden spear.", "\u2018Where there\u2019s one of us, straight\n\naway there will be the other!", "Whenever I am remembered, you will at once\n\nbe remembered, too!", "I, the foundling, the son of unknown parents, and you,\n\nthe son of an astrologer-king and a miller\u2019s daughter, the beautiful Pila.\u20193\n\n\u2018Yes, and don\u2019t you forget to remember me, the astrologer\u2019s son,\u2019 Pilate\n\nasked in his dream.", "And securing in his dream a nod from the En-Sarid4\n\nbeggar who was walking beside him, the cruel procurator of Judea wept and\n\nlaughed from joy in his dream.", "This was all very good, but the more terrible was the hegemon\u2019s\n\nawakening.", "Banga growled at the moon, and the pale-blue road, slippery as\n\nthough smoothed with oil, fell away before the procurator.", "He opened his\n\neyes, and the first thing he remembered was that the execution had been.", "The first thing the procurator did was to clutch Banga\u2019s collar with a\n\nhabitual gesture, then with sick eyes he began searching for the moon and\n\nsaw that it had moved slightly to the side and turned silvery.", "Its light was\n\nbeing interfered with by an unpleasant, restless light playing on the balcony\n\nright before his eyes.", "A torch blazed and smoked in the hand of the\n\ncenturion Ratslayer.", "The holder of it glanced sidelong with fear and spite at\n\nthe dangerous beast preparing itself to leap.", "\u2018Stay, Banga,\u2019 the procurator said in a sick voice and coughed.", "Shielding\n\nhimself from the flame with his hand, he went on: \u2018Even at night, even by\n\nmoonlight, I have no

never makes mistakes.", "That man is you.\u2019\n\n\u2018Matthew Levi was taken in the cart with the bodies of the executed men,\n\nand in about two hours they reached a solitary ravine north of Yershalaim.", "There the detachment, working in shifts, dug a deep hole within an hour and\n\nburied all three executed men in it.\u2019\n\n\u2018Naked?\u2019\n\n\u2018No, Procurator, the detachment

shouted:\n\n\u2018To me, here!", "A lamp to the colonnade!\u2019\n\nAphranius was going out to the garden when lights began to flash in the\n\nhands of servants behind Pilate\u2019s back.", "Three lamps appeared on the table\n\nbefore the procurator, and the moonlit night at once retreated to the garden,\n\nas if Aphranius had led it away with him.", "In place of Aphranius, an\n\nunknown man, small and skinny, stepped on to the balcony beside the\n\ngigantic centurion.", "The latter, catching the procurator\u2019s eye, withdrew to the\n\ngarden at once and there disappeared.", "The procurator studied the newcomer with greedy and slightly frightened\n\neyes.", "So one looks at a man of whom one has heard a great deal, of whom\n\none has been thinking, and who finally appears.", "The newcomer, a man of about forty, was black-haired, ragged, covered\n\nwith caked mud, and looked wolf-like from under his knitted brows.", "In\n\nshort, he was very unsightly, and rather resembled a city beggar, of whom\n\nthere were many hanging about on the porches of the temple or in the\n\nbazaars of the noisy and dirty Lower City.", "The silence continued for a long time, and was broken by the strange\n\nbehaviour of the man brought to Pilate.", "His countenance changed, he\n\nswayed, and if he had not grasped the edge of the table with his dirty hand,\n\nhe would have fallen.", "\u2018What\u2019s wrong with you?\u2019 Pilate asked him.", "\u2018Nothing,\u2019 answered Matthew Levi, and he made a movement as if he\n\nwere swallowing something.", "His skinny, bare, grey neck swelled out and\n\nthen slackened again.", "\u2018What\u2019s wrong, answer me,\u2019 Pilate repeated.", "\u2018I\u2019m tired,\u2019 Levi answered and looked sullenly at the floor.", "\u2018Sit down,\u2019 said Pilate, pointing to the armchair.", "Levi looked at the procurator mistrustfully, moved towards the armchair,\n\ngave a timorous sidelong glance at the gilded armrests, and sat down not in\n\nthe chair but beside it on the floor.", "\u2018Explain to me, why did you not sit in the chair?\u2019 asked Pilate.", "\u2018I\u2019m dirty, I\u2019d soil it,\u2019 said Levi, looking at the ground.", "\u2018You\u2019ll presently be given something to eat.\u2019\n\n\u2018I don\u2019t want to eat,\u2019 answered Levi.", "\u2018Why lie?\u2019 Pilate asked quietly.", "\u2018You haven\u2019t eaten for the whole day, and\n\nmaybe even longer.", "Very well, don\u2019t eat.", "I\u2019ve summoned you so that you\n\ncould show me the knife you had with you.\u2019\n\n\u2018The soldiers took it from me when they brought me here,\u2019 Levi replied\n\nand added sullenly: \u2018You must give it back to me, I have to return it to its\n\nowner, I stole it.\u2019\n\n\u2018What for?\u2019\n\n\u2018To cut the ropes,\u2019 answered Levi.", "\u2018Mark!\u2019 cried the procurator, and the centurion stepped in under the\n\ncolumns.", "\u2018Give me his knife.\u2019\n\nThe centurion took a dirty bread knife from one of the two cases on his\n\nbelt, handed it to the procurator, and withdrew.", "\u2018Who did you take the knife from?\u2019\n\n\u2018From the bakery by the Hebron gate, just as you enter the city, on the\n\nleft.\u2019\n\nPilate looked at the broad blade, for some reason tried the sharpness of\n\nthe edge with his finger, and said:\n\n\u2018Concerning the knife you needn\u2019t worry, the knife will be returned to the\n\nshop.", "But now I want a second thing \u2014 show me the charta you carry with\n\nyou, on which Yeshua\u2019s words are written down.\u2019\n\nLevi looked at Pilate with hatred and smiled such an inimical smile that\n\nhis face became completely ugly.", "\u2018You want to take away the last thing?\u2019 he asked.", "\u2018I didn\u2019t say \u201cgive me\u201d,\u2019 answered Pilate, \u2018I said \u201cshow me\u201d.\u2019\n\nLevi fumbled in his bosom and produced a parchment scroll.", "Pilate took\n\nit, unrolled it, spread it out between the lights, and, squinting, began to\n\nstudy the barely legible ink marks.", "It was difficult to understand these\n\ncrabbed lines, and Pilate kept wincing and leaning right to the parchment,\n\nrunning his finger over the lines.", "He did manage to make out that the\n\nwriting represented an incoherent chain of certain utterances, certain dates,\n\nhousehold records, and poetic fragments.", "Some of it Pilate could read: \u2018...\n\nthere is no death ... yesterday we ate sweet spring baccuroth ...\u20197\n\nGrimacing with the effort, Pilate squinted as he read: \u2018... we shall see the\n\npure river of the water of life8 ... mankind shall look at the sun through\n\ntransparent crystal ...\u2019 Here Pilate gave a start.", "In the last lines of the\n\nparchment he made out the words: \u2018... greater vice ... cowardice...\u2019\n\nPilate rolled up the parchment and with an abrupt movement handed it to\n\nLevi.", "\u2018Take it,\u2019 he said and, after a pause, added: \u2018You\u2019re a bookish man, I see,\n\nand there\u2019s no need for you to go around alone, in beggar\u2019s clothing,\n\nwithout shelter.", "I have a big library in Caesarea, I am very rich and want to\n\ntake you to work for me.", "You will sort out and look after the papyri, you\n\nwill be fed and clothed.\u2019\n\nLevi stood up and replied:\n\n\u2018No, I don\u2019t want to.\u2019\n\n\u2018Why?\u2019 the procurator asked, his face darkening.", "\u2018Am I disagreeable to\n\nyou?", "... Are you afraid of me?\u2019\n\nThe same bad smile distorted Levi\u2019s face, and he said:\n\n\u2018No, because you\u2019ll be afraid of me.", "It won\u2019t be very easy for you to look\n\nme in the face now that you\u2019ve killed him.\u2019\n\n\u2018Quiet,\u2019 replied Pilate.", "\u2018Take some money.\u2019\n\nLevi shook his head negatively, and the procurator went on:\n\n\u2018I know you consider yourself a disciple of Yeshua, but I can tell you that\n\nyou learned nothing of what he taught you.", "For if you had, you would\n\ncertainly take something from me.", "Bear in mind that before he died he said\n\nhe did not blame anyone.\u2019 Pilate raised a finger significantly, Pilate\u2019s face\n\nwas twitching.", "\u2018And he himself would surely have taken something.", "You\n\nare cruel, and he was not cruel.", "Where will you go?\u2019\n\nLevi suddenly came up to the table, leaned both hands on it, and, gazing\n\nat the procurator with burning eyes, whispered to him:\n\n\u2018Know, Hegemon, that I am going to kill a man in Yershalaim.", "I wanted\n\nto tell you that, so you\u2019d know there will be more blood.\u2019\n\n\u2018I, too, know there will be more of it,\u2019 replied Pilate, \u2018you haven\u2019t\n\nsurprised me with your words.", "You want, of course, to kill me?\u2019\n\n\u2018You I won\u2019t manage to kill,\u2019 replied Levi, baring his teeth and smiling,\n\n\u2018I\u2019m not such a foolish man as to count on that.", "But I\u2019ll kill Judas of\n\nKiriath, I\u2019ll devote the rest of my life to it.\u2019\n\nHere pleasure showed in the procurator\u2019s eyes, and beckoning Matthew\n\nLevi to come closer, he said:\n\n\u2018You won\u2019t manage to do it, don\u2019t trouble yourself.", "Judas has already\n\nbeen killed this night.\u2019\n\nLevi sprang away from the table, looking wildly around, and cried out:\n\n\u2018Who did it?\u2019\n\n\u2018Don\u2019t be jealous,\u2019 Pilate answered, his teeth bared, and rubbed his\n\nhands, \u2018I\u2019m afraid he had other admirers besides you.\u2019\n\n\u2018Who did it?\u2019 Levi repeated in a whisper.", "Pilate answered him:\n\n\u2018I did it.\u2019\n\nLevi opened his mouth and stared at the procurator, who said quietly:\n\n\u2018It is, of course, not much to have done, but all the same I did it.\u2019 And he\n\nadded: \u2018Well, and now will you take something?\u2019\n\nLevi considered, relented, and finally said:\n\n\u2018Have them give me a piece of clean parchment.\u2019\n\nAn hour went by.", "Levi was not in the palace.", "Now the silence of the\n\ndawn was broken only by the quiet noise of the sentries\u2019 footsteps in the\n\ngarden.", "The moon was quickly losing its colour, one could see at the other\n\nedge of the sky the whitish dot of the morning star.", "The lamps had gone out\n\nlong, long ago.", "The procurator lay on the couch.", "Putting his hand under his\n\ncheek, he slept and breathed soundlessly.", "Beside him slept Banga.", "Thus was the dawn of the fifteenth day of Nisan met by the fifth\n\nprocurator of Judea, Pontius Pilate.", "CHAPTER 27\n\nThe End of Apartment No.", "50\n\nWhen Margarita came to the last words of the chapter \u2014 \u2018...", "Thus was the\n\ndawn of the fifteenth day of Nisan met by the fifth procurator of Judea,\n\nPontius Pilate\u2019 \u2014 it was morning.", "Sparrows could be heard in the branches of the willows and lindens in the\n\nlittle garden, conducting a merry, excited morning conversation.", "Margarita got up from the armchair, stretched, and only then felt how\n\nbroken her body was and how much she wanted to sleep.", "It is interesting to\n\nnote that Margarita\u2019s soul was in perfect order.", "Her thoughts were not\n\nscattered, she was quite unshaken by having spent the night supernaturally.", "She was not troubled by memories of having been at Satan\u2019s ball, or that by\n\nsome miracle the master had been returned to her, that the novel had risen\n\nfrom the ashes, that everything was back in place in the basement in the\n\nlane, from which the snitcher Aloisy Mogarych had been expelled.", "In short,\n\nacquaintance with Woland had caused her no psychic damage.", "Everything\n\nwas as if it ought to have been so.", "She went to the next room, convinced herself that the master was soundly\n\nand peacefully asleep, turned off the unnecessary table lamp, and stretched\n\nout by the opposite wall on a little couch covered with an old, torn sheet.", "A\n\nminute later she was asleep, and that morning she had no dreams.", "The\n\nbasement rooms were silent, the builder\u2019s whole little house was silent, and\n\nit was quiet in the solitary lane.", "But just then, that is, at dawn on Saturday, an entire floor of a certain\n\nMoscow institution was not asleep, and its windows, looking out on a big\n\nasphalt-paved square which special machines, driving around slowly and\n\ndroning, were cleaning with brushes, shone with their full brightness,\n\ncutting through the light of the rising sun.", "The whole floor was occupied with the investigation of the Woland case,\n\nand the lights had burned all night in dozens of offices.", "Essentially speaking, the matter had already become clear on the\n\nprevious day, Friday, when the Variety had had to be closed, owing to the\n\ndisappearance of its administration and all sorts of outrages which had\n\ntaken place during the notorious seance of black magic the day before.", "But\n\nthe thing was that more and more new material kept arriving all the time\n\nand incessantly on the sleepless floor.", "Now the investigators of this strange case, which smacked of obvious\n\ndevilry, with an admixture of some hypnotic tricks and distinct criminality,\n\nhad to shape into one lump all the many-sided and tangled events that had\n\ntaken place in various parts of Moscow.", "The first to visit the sleepless, electrically lit-up floor was Arkady\n\nApollonovich Sempleyarov, chairman of the Acoustics Commission.", "After dinner on Friday, in his apartment located in a house by the\n\nKamenny Bridge, the telephone rang and a male voice asked for Arkady\n\nApollonovich.", "Arkady Apollonovich\u2019s wife, who picked up the phone,\n\nreplied sullenly that Arkady Apollonovich was unwell, had retired for the\n\nnight, and could not come to the phone.", "However, Arkady Apollonovich\n\ncame to the phone all the same.", "To the question of where Arkady\n\nApollonovich was being called from, the voice in the telephone had said\n\nvery briefly where it was from.", "\u2018This second ... at once ... this minute ...\u2019 babbled the ordinarily very\n\nhaughty wife of the chairman of the Acoustics Commission, and she flew to\n\nthe bedroom like an arrow to rouse Arkady Apollonovich from his bed,\n\nwhere he lay experiencing the torments of hell at the recollection of\n\nyesterday\u2019s seance and the night\u2019s scandal, followed by the expulsion of his\n\nSaratov niece from the apartment.", "Not in a second, true, yet not in a minute either, but in a quarter of a\n\nminute, Arkady Apollonovich, with one slipper on his left foot, in nothing\n\nbut his underwear, was already at the phone, babbling into it:\n\n\u2018Yes, it\u2019s me ... I\u2019m listening, I\u2019m listening ...\u2019\n\nHis wife, forgetting for these moments all the loathsome crimes against\n\nfidelity in which the unfortunate Arkady Apollonovich had been exposed,\n\nkept sticking herself out the door to the corridor with a frightened face,\n\npoking a slipper at the air and whispering:\n\n\u2018Put the slipper on, the slipper ... you\u2019ll catch cold ...\u2019 At which Arkady\n\nApollonovich, waving his wife away with his bare foot and making savage\n\neyes at her, muttered into the telephone:\n\n\u2018Yes, yes, yes, surely ...", "I understand ... I\u2019ll leave at once ...\u2019\n\nArkady Apollonovich spent the whole evening on that same floor where\n\nthe investigation was being conducted.", "It was a difficult conversation, a most unpleasant conversation, for he had\n\nto tell with complete sincerity not only about this obnoxious seance and the\n\nfight in the box, but along with that \u2014 as was indeed necessary - also about\n\nMilitsa Andreevna Pokobatko from Yelokhovskaya Street, and about the\n\nSaratov niece, and about much else, the telling of which caused Arkady\n\nApollonovich inexpressible torments.", "Needless to say, the testimony of Arkady Apollonovich, an intelligent\n\nand cultivated man, who had been a witness to the outrageous seance, a\n\nsensible and qualified witness, who gave an excellent description of the\n\nmysterious masked magician himself and of his two scoundrelly assistants,\n\na witness who remembered perfectly well that the magician\u2019s name was\n\nindeed Woland, advanced the investigation considerably.", "And the\n\njuxtaposition of Arkady Apollonovich\u2019s testimony with the testimony of\n\nothers \u2014 among whom were some ladies who had suffered after the seance\n\n(the one in violet underwear who had shocked Rimsky and, alas, many\n\nothers), and the messenger Karpov, who had been sent to apartment no.", "50\n\non Sadovaya Street \u2014 at once essentially established the place where the\n\nculprit in all these adventures was to be sought.", "Apartment no.", "50 was visited, and not just once, and not only was it\n\nlooked over with extreme thoroughness, but the walls were also tapped and\n\nthe fireplace flues checked, in search of hiding places.", "However, none of\n\nthese measures yielded any results, and no one was discovered in the\n\napartment during any of these visits, though it was perfectly clear that there\n\nwas someone in the apartment, despite the fact that all persons who in one\n\nway or another were supposed to be in charge of foreign artistes coming to\n\nMoscow decidedly and categorically insisted that there was not and could\n\nnot be any black magician Woland in Moscow.", "He had decidedly not registered anywhere on arrival, had not shown\n\nanyone his passport or other papers, contracts, or agreements, and no one\n\nhad heard anything about him!", "Kitaitsev, head of the programme\n\ndepartment of the Spectacles Commission, swore to God that the vanished\n\nStyopa Likhodeev had never sent him any performance programme of any\n\nWoland for approval and had never telephoned him about the arrival of such\n\na Woland.", "So that he, Kitaitsev, utterly failed to see and understand how\n\nStyopa could have allowed such a seance in the Variety.", "And when told that\n\nArkady Apollonovich had seen this magician at the seance with his own\n\neyes, Kitaitsev only spread his arms and raised his eyes to heaven.", "And\n\nfrom Kitaitsev\u2019s eyes alone one could see and say confidently that he was as\n\npure as crystal.", "That same Prokhor Petrovich, chairman of the main Spectacles\n\nCommission ...\n\nIncidentally, he returned to his suit immediately after the police came\n\ninto his office, to the ecstatic joy of Anna Richardovna and the great\n\nperplexity of the needlessly troubled police.", "Also, incidentally, having returned to his place, into his grey striped suit,\n\nProkhor Petrovich fully approved of all the resolutions the suit had written\n\nduring his short-term absence.", "...", "So, then, this same Prokhor Petrovich knew decidedly nothing about\n\nany Woland.", "Whether you will or no, something preposterous was coming out:\n\nthousands of spectators, the whole staff of the Variety, and finally\n\nSempleyarov, Arkady Apollonovich, a most educated man, had seen this\n\nmagician, as well as his thrice-cursed assistants, and yet it was absolutely\n\nimpossible to find him anywhere.", "What was it, may I ask, had he fallen\n\nthrough the ground right after his disgusting seance, or, as some affirm, had\n\nhe not come to Moscow at all?", "But if the first is allowed, then undoubtedly,\n\nin falling through, he had taken along the entire top administration of the\n\nVariety, and if the second, then would it not mean that the administration of\n\nthe luckless theatre itself, after first committing some vileness (only recall\n\nthe broken window in the study and the behaviour of Ace of Diamonds!", "),\n\nhad disappeared from Moscow without a trace?", "We must do justice to the one who headed the investigation.", "The\n\nvanished Rimsky was found with amazing speed.", "One had only to put\n\ntogether the behaviour of Ace of Diamonds at the cab stand by the movie\n\ntheatre with certain given times, such as when the seance ended, and\n\nprecisely when Rimsky could have disappeared, and then immediately send\n\na telegram to Leningrad.", "An hour later (towards evening on Friday) came\n\nthe reply that Rimsky had been discovered in number four-twelve on the\n\nfourth floor of the Hotel Astoria, next to the room in which the repertory\n\nmanager of one of the Moscow theatres, then on tour in Leningrad, was\n\nstaying \u2014 that same room which, as is known, had gilded grey-blue\n\nfurniture and a wonderful bathroom.1\n\nDiscovered hiding in the wardrobe of number four-twelve of the Astoria,\n\nRimsky was questioned right there in Leningrad.", "After which a telegram\n\ncame to Moscow reporting that findirector Rimsky was in an unanswerable\n\nstate, that he could not or did not wish to give sensible replies to questions\n\nand begged only to be hidden in a bulletproof room and provided with an\n\narmed guard.", "A telegram from Moscow ordered that Rimsky be delivered to Moscow\n\nunder guard, as a result of which Rimsky departed Friday evening, under\n\nsaid guard, on the evening train.", "Towards evening on that same Friday, Likhodeev\u2019s trail was also found.", "Telegrams of inquiry about Likhodeev were sent to all cities, and from Yalta\n\ncame the reply that Likhodeev had been in Yalta but had left on a plane for\n\nMoscow.", "The only one whose trail they failed to pick up was Varenukha.", "The\n\nfamous theatre administrator known to decidedly all of Moscow had\n\nvanished into thin air.", "In the meantime, there was some bother with things happening in other\n\nparts of Moscow, outside the Variety Theatre.", "It was necessary to explain\n\nthe extraordinary case of the staff all singing \u2018Glorious Sea\u2019 (incidentally,\n\nProfessor Stravinsky managed to put them right within two hours, by means\n\nof some subcutaneous injections), of persons presenting other persons or\n\ninstitutions with devil knows what in the guise of money, and also of\n\npersons who had suffered from such presentations.", "As goes without saying, the most unpleasant, the most scandalous and\n\ninsoluble of all these cases was the case of the theft of the head of the\n\ndeceased writer Berlioz right from the coffin in the hall of Griboedov\u2018s,\n\ncarried out in broad daylight.", "Twelve men conducted the investigation, gathering as on a knitting-\n\nneedle the accursed stitches of this complicated case scattered all over\n\nMoscow.", "One of the investigators arrived at Professor Stravinsky\u2019s clinic and first\n\nof all asked to be shown a list of the persons who had checked in to the\n\nclinic over the past three days.", "Thus they discovered Nikanor Ivanovich\n\nBosoy and the unfortunate master of ceremonies whose head had been torn\n\noff.", "However, little attention was paid to them.", "By now it was easy to\n\nestablish that these two had fallen victim to the same gang, headed by that\n\nmysterious magician.", "But to Ivan Nikolaevich Homeless the investigator\n\npaid great attention.", "The door of Ivanushka\u2019s room no.", "117 opened towards evening on\n\nFriday, and into the room came a young, round-faced, calm and mild-\n\nmannered man, who looked quite unlike an investigator and yet was one of\n\nthe best in Moscow.", "He saw lying on the bed a pale and pinched young\n\nman, in whose eyes one could read a lack of interest in what went on\n\naround him, whose eyes looked now somewhere into the distance, over his\n\nsurroundings, now into the young man himself.", "The investigator gently\n\nintroduced himself and said he had stopped at Ivan Nikolaevich\u2019s to talk\n\nover the events at the Patriarch\u2019s Ponds two days ago.", "Oh, how triumphant Ivan would have been if the investigator had come\n\nto him earlier \u2014 say, on Wednesday night, when Ivan had striven so\n\nviolently and passionately to make his story about the Patriarch\u2019s Ponds\n\nheard!", "Now his dream of helping to catch the consultant had come true,\n\nthere was no longer any need to run after anyone, they had come to him on\n\ntheir own, precisely to hear his story about what had happened on\n\nWednesday evening.", "But, alas, Ivanushka had changed completely in the time that had passed\n\nsince the moment of Berlioz\u2019s death: he was ready to answer all of the\n\ninvestigator\u2019s questions willingly and politely, but indifference could be\n\nsensed both in Ivan\u2019s eyes and in his intonation.", "The poet was no longer\n\nconcerned with Berlioz\u2019s fate.", "Before the investigator\u2019s arrival, Ivanushka lay dozing, and certain\n\nvisions passed before him.", "Thus, he saw a city, strange, incomprehensible,\n\nnon-existent, with marble masses, eroded colonnades, roofs gleaming in the\n\nsun, with the black, gloomy and merciless Antonia Tower, with the palace\n\non the western hill sunk almost up to its rooftops in the tropical greenery of\n\nthe garden, with bronze statues blazing in the sunset above this greenery,\n\nand he saw armour-clad Roman centuries moving along under the walls of\n\nthe ancient city.", "As he dozed, there appeared before Ivan a man, motionless in an\n\narmchair, clean-shaven, with a harried yellow face, a man in a white mantle\n\nwith red lining, gazing hatefully into the luxurious and alien garden.", "Ivan\n\nalso saw a treeless yellow hill with empty cross-barred posts.", "And what had happened at the Patriarch\u2019s Ponds no longer interested the\n\npoet Ivan Homeless.", "\u2018Tell me, Ivan Nikolaevich, how far were you from the turnstile yourself\n\nwhen Berlioz slipped under the tram-car?\u2019\n\nA barely noticeable, indifferent smile touched Ivan\u2019s lips for some\n\nreason, and he replied:\n\n\u2018I was far away.\u2019\n\n\u2018And the checkered one was right by the turnstile?\u2019\n\n\u2018No, he was sitting on a little bench nearby.\u2019\n\n\u2018You clearly recall that he did not go up to the turnstile at the moment\n\nwhen Berlioz fell?\u2019\n\n\u2018I recall.", "He didn\u2019t go up to it.", "He sat sprawled on the bench.\u2019\n\nThese questions were the investigator\u2019s last.", "After them he got up, gave\n\nIvanushka his hand, wished him a speedy recovery, and expressed the hope\n\nthat he would soon be reading his poetry again.", "\u2018No,\u2019 Ivan quietly replied, \u2018I won\u2019t write any more poetry.\u2019\n\nThe investigator smiled politely, allowed himself to express his certainty\n\nthat, while the poet was presently in a state of some depression, it would\n\nsoon pass.", "\u2018No,\u2019 Ivan responded, looking not at the investigator but into the\n\ndistance, at the fading sky, \u2018it will never pass.", "The poems I used to write\n\nwere bad poems, and now I understand it.\u2019\n\nThe investigator left Ivanushka, having obtained some quite important\n\nmaterial.", "Following the thread of events from the end to the beginning, they\n\nfinally succeeded in reaching the source from which all the events had\n\ncome.", "The investigator had no doubt that these events began with the\n\nmurder at the Patriarch\u2019s Ponds.", "Of course, neither Ivanushka nor this\n\ncheckered one had pushed the unfortunate chairman of Massolit under the\n\ntram-car; physically, so to speak, no one had contributed to his falling under\n\nthe wheels.", "But the investigator was convinced that Berlioz had thrown\n\nhimself under the tram-car (or tumbled under it) while hypnotized.", "Yes, there was already a lot of material, and it was known who had to be\n\ncaught and where.", "But the thing was that it proved in no way possible to\n\ncatch anyone.", "We must repeat, there undoubtedly was someone in the\n\nthrice-cursed apartment no.", "50.", "Occasionally the apartment answered\n\ntelephone calls, now in a rattling, now in a nasal voice, occasionally one of\n\nits windows was opened, what\u2019s more, the sounds of a gramophone came\n\nfrom it.", "And yet each time it was visited, decidedly no one was found there.", "And it had already been visited more than once and at different times of\n\nday.", "And not only that, but they had gone through it with a net, checking\n\nevery comer.", "The apartment had long been under suspicion.", "Guards were\n\nplaced not just at the way to the courtyard through the gates, but at the back\n\nentrance as well.", "Not only that, but guards were placed on the roof by the\n\nchimneys.", "Yes, apartment no.", "50 was acting up, and it was impossible to do\n\nanything about it.", "So the thing dragged on until midnight on Friday, when Baron Meigel,\n\ndressed in evening clothes and patent-leather shoes, solemnly proceeded\n\ninto apartment no.", "50 in the quality of a guest.", "One could hear the baron\n\nbeing let in to the apartment.", "Exactly ten minutes later, without any ringing\n\nof bells, the apartment was visited, yet not only were the hosts not found in\n\nit, but, which was something quite bizarre, no signs of Baron Meigel were\n\nfound in it either.", "And so, as was said, the thing dragged on in this fashion until dawn on\n\nSaturday.", "Here new and very interesting data were added.", "A six-place\n\npassenger plane, coming from the Crimea, landed at the Moscow airport.", "Among the other passengers, one strange passenger got out of it.", "This was a\n\nyoung citizen, wildly overgrown with stubble, unwashed for three days,\n\nwith inflamed and frightened eyes, carrying no luggage and dressed\n\nsomewhat whimsically.", "The citizen was wearing a tall sheepskin hat, a\n\nGeorgian felt cape over a nightshirt, and new, just-purchased, blue leather\n\nbedroom slippers.", "As soon as he separated from the ladder by which they\n\ndescended from the plane, he was approached.", "This citizen had been\n\nexpected, and in a little while the unforgettable director of the Variety,\n\nStepan Bogdanovich Likhodeev, was standing before the investigators.", "He\n\nthrew in some new data.", "It now became clear that Woland had penetrated\n\nthe Variety in the guise of an artiste, having hypnotized Styopa Likhodeev,\n\nand had then contrived to fling this same Styopa out of Moscow and God\n\nknows how many miles away.", "The material was thus augmented, yet that\n\ndid not make things easier, but perhaps even a bit harder, because it was\n\nbecoming obvious that to lay hold of a person who could perform such\n\nstunts as the one of which Stepan Bogdanovich had been the victim would\n\nnot be so easy.", "Incidentally, Likhodeev, at his own request, was confined in\n\na secure cell, and next before the investigators stood Varenukha, just\n\narrested in his own apartment, to which he had returned after a blank\n\ndisappearance of almost two days.", "Despite the promise he had given Azazello not to lie any more, the\n\nadministrator began precisely with a lie.", "Though, by the way, he cannot be\n\njudged very harshly for it.", "Azazello had forbidden him to lie and be rude on\n\nthe telephone, but in the present case the administrator spoke without the\n\nassistance of this apparatus.", "His eyes wandering, Ivan Savelyevich declared\n\nthat on Thursday afternoon he had got drunk in his office at the Variety, all\n\nby himself, after which he went somewhere, but where he did not\n\nremember, drank starka2 somewhere, but where he did not remember, lay\n\nabout somewhere under a fence, but where he again did not remember.", "Only after the administrator was told that with his behaviour, stupid and\n\nsenseless, he was hindering the investigation of an important case and\n\nwould of course have to answer for it, did Varenukha burst into sobs and\n\nwhisper in a trembling voice, looking around him, that he had lied solely\n\nout of fear, apprehensive of the revenge of Woland\u2019s gang, into whose\n\nhands he had already fallen, and that he begged, implored and yearned to be\n\nlocked up in a bulletproof cell.", "\u2018Pah, the devil!", "Really, them and their bulletproof cells!\u2019 grumbled one of\n\nthe investigators.", "\u2018They\u2019ve been badly frightened by those scoundrels,\u2019 said the\n\ninvestigator who had visited Ivanushka.", "They calmed Varenukha down the best they could, said they would\n\nprotect him without any cell, and here it was learned that he had not drunk\n\nany starka under a fence, and that he had been beaten by two, one red-\n\nhaired and with a fang, the other fat ...\n\n\u2018Ah, resembling a cat?\u2019\n\n\u2018Yes, yes, yes,\u2019 whispered the administrator, sinking with fear and\n\nlooking around him every second, coming out with further details of how he\n\nhad existed for some two days in apartment no.", "50 in the quality of a tip-off\n\nvampire, who had all but caused the death of the findirector Rimsky ...\n\nJust then Rimsky, brought on the Leningrad train, was being led in.", "However, this mentally disturbed, grey-haired old man, trembling with fear,\n\nin whom it was very difficult to recognize the former findirector, would not\n\ntell the truth for anything, and proved to be very stubborn in this respect.", "Rimsky insisted that he had not seen any Hella in his office window at\n\nnight, nor any Varenukha, but had simply felt bad and in a state of\n\nunconsciousness had left for Leningrad.", "Needless to say, the ailing\n\nfindirector concluded his testimony with a request that he be confined to a\n\nbulletproof cell.", "Annushka was arrested just as she made an attempt to hand a ten-dollar\n\nbill to the cashier of a department store on the Arbat.", "Annushka\u2019s story\n\nabout people flying out the window of the house on Sadovaya and about the\n\nlittle horseshoe which Annushka, in her own words, had picked up in order\n\nto present it to the police, was listened to attentively.", "\u2018The horseshoe was really made of gold and diamonds?\u2019 Annushka was\n\nasked.", "\u2018As if I don\u2019t know diamonds,\u2019 replied Annushka.", "\u2018But he gave you ten-rouble bills, you say?\u2019\n\n\u2018As if I don\u2019t know ten-rouble bills,\u2019 replied Annushka.", "\u2018Well, and when did they turn into dollars?\u2019\n\n\u2018I don\u2019t know anything about any dollars, I never saw any dollars!\u2019\n\nAnnushka replied shrilly.", "\u2018I\u2019m in my rights!", "I got recompensed, I was\n\nbuying cloth with it,\u2019 and she went off into some balderdash about not being\n\nanswerable for the house management that allowed unclean powers on to\n\nthe fifth floor, making life unbearable.", "Here the investigator waved at Annushka with his pen, because everyone\n\nwas properly sick of her, and wrote a pass for her to get out on a green slip\n\nof paper, after which, to everyone\u2019s pleasure, Annushka disappeared from\n\nthe building.", "Then there followed one after another a whole series of people, Nikolai\n\nIvanovich among them, just arrested owing solely to the foolishness of his\n\njealous wife, who towards morning had informed the police that her\n\nhusband had vanished.", "Nikolai Ivanovich did not surprise the investigators\n\nvery much when he laid on the table the clownish certificate of his having\n\nspent the time at Satan\u2019s ball.", "In his stories of how he had carried Margarita\n\nNikolaevna\u2019s naked housekeeper on his back through the air, somewhere to\n\nhell and beyond, for a swim in a river, and of the preceding appearance of\n\nthe bare Margarita Nikolaevna in the window, Nikolai Ivanovich departed\n\nsomewhat from the truth.", "Thus, for instance, he did not consider it\n\nnecessary to mention that he had arrived in the bedroom with the discarded\n\nshift in his hands, or that he had called Natasha \u2018Venus\u2019.", "From his words it\n\nlooked as if Natasha had flown out the window, got astride him, and\n\ndragged him away from Moscow ...\n\n\u2018Obedient to constraint, I was compelled to submit,\u2019 Nikolai Ivanovich\n\nsaid, and finished his tale with a request that not a word of it be told to his\n\nwife.", "Which was promised him.", "The testimony of Nikolai Ivanovich provided an opportunity for\n\nestablishing that Margarita Nikolaevna as well as her housekeeper Natasha\n\nhad vanished without a trace.", "Measures were taken to find them.", "Thus every second of Saturday morning was marked by the unrelenting\n\ninvestigation.", "In the city during that time, completely impossible rumours\n\nemerged and floated about, in which a tiny portion of truth was embellished\n\nwith the most luxuriant lies.", "It was said that there had been a seance at the\n\nVariety after which all two thousand spectators ran out to the street in their\n\nbirthday suits, that a press for making counterfeit money of a magic sort\n\nhad been nabbed on Sadovaya Street, that some gang had kidnapped five\n\nmanagers from the entertainment sector, but the police had immediately\n\nfound them all, and many other things that one does not even wish to\n\nrepeat.", "Meanwhile it was getting on towards dinner time, and then, in the place\n\nwhere the investigation was being conducted, the telephone rang.", "From\n\nSadovaya came a report that the accursed apartment was again showing\n\nsigns of life.", "It was said that its windows had been opened from inside, that\n\nsounds of a piano and singing were coming from it, and that a black cat had\n\nbeen seen in a window, sitting on the sill and basking in the sun.", "At around four o\u2018clock on that hot day, a big company of men in civilian\n\nclothes got out of three cars a short distance from no.", "302-bis on Sadovaya\n\nStreet.", "Here the big group divided into two small ones, the first going under\n\nthe gateway of the house and across the courtyard directly to the sixth\n\nentrance,

Koroviev in his usual outfit and not\n\nthe festive tailcoat \u2014 were sitting in the dining room of the apartment\n\nfinishing breakfast.", "Woland, as was his wont, was in the bedroom, and\n\nwhere the cat was nobody knew.", "But judging by the clatter of dishes\n\ncoming from the kitchen, it could be supposed that Behemoth was precisely\n\nthere, playing the fool, as was his wont.", "\u2018And what are those footsteps on the stairs?\u2019 asked Koroviev, toying with\n\nthe little spoon in his cup of black coffee.", "\u2018That\u2019s them coming to arrest us,\u2019 Azazello replied and drank off a glass\n\nof cognac.", "\u2018Ahh ... well, well ...\u2019 Koroviev replied to that.", "The ones going up the front stairway were already on the third-floor\n\nlanding.", "There a couple of plumbers were pottering over the harmonica of\n\nthe steam heating.", "The newcomers exchanged significant glances with the\n\nplumbers.", "\u2018They\u2019re all at home,\u2019 whispered one of the plumbers, tapping a pipe\n\nwith his hammer.", "Then the one walking at the head openly took a black Mauser from under\n\nhis coat, and another beside him took out the skeleton keys.", "Generally,\n\nthose going to apartment no.", "50 were properly equipped.", "Two of them had\n\nfine, easily unfolded silk nets in their pockets.", "Another of them had a lasso,\n\nanother had gauze masks and ampoules of chloroform.", "In a second the front door to apartment no.", "50 was open and all the\n\nvisitors were in the front hall, while the slamming of the door in the kitchen\n\nat the same moment indicated the timely arrival of the second group from\n\nthe back stairs.", "This time there was, if not complete, at least some sort of success.", "The\n\nmen instantly dispersed through all the rooms and found no one anywhere,\n\nbut instead on the table of the dining room they discovered the remains of\n\nan apparently just-abandoned breakfast, and in the living room, on the\n\nmantelpiece, beside a crystal pitcher, sat an enormous black cat.", "He was\n\nholding a primus in his paws.", "Those who entered the living room contemplated this cat for quite a long\n\ntime in total silence.", "\u2018Hm, yes ... that\u2019s quite something ...\u2019 one of the men whispered.", "\u2018Ain\u2019t misbehaving, ain\u2019t bothering anybody, just reparating my primus,\u2019\n\nsaid the cat with an unfriendly scowl, \u2018and I also consider it my duty to\n\nwarn you that the cat is an ancient and inviolable animal.\u2019\n\n\u2018Exceptionally neat job,\u2019 whispered one of the men, and another said\n\nloudly and distinctly:\n\n\u2018Well, come right in, you inviolable, ventriloquous cat!\u2019\n\nThe net unfolded and soared upwards, but the man who cast it, to\n\neveryone\u2019s utter astonishment, missed and only caught the pitcher, which\n\nstraight away smashed ringingly.", "\u2018You lose!\u2019 bawled the cat.", "\u2018Hurrah!\u2019 and here, setting the primus aside,\n\nhe snatched a Browning from behind his back.", "In a trice he aimed it at the\n\nman standing closest, but before the cat had time to shoot, fire blazed in the\n\nman\u2019s hand, and at the blast of the Mauser the cat plopped head first from\n\nthe mantelpiece on to the floor, dropping the Browning and letting go of the\n\nprimus.", "\u2018It\u2019s all over,\u2019 the cat said in a weak voice, sprawled languidly in a pool\n\nof blood, \u2018step back from me for a second, let me say farewell to the earth.", "Oh, my friend Azazello,\u2019 moaned the cat, bleeding profusely, \u2018where are\n\nyou?\u2019 The cat rolled his fading eyes in the direction of the dining-room\n\ndoor.", "\u2018You did not come to my aid in the moment of unequal battle, you\n\nabandoned poor Behemoth, exchanging him for a glass of \u2014 admittedly\n\nvery good \u2014 cognac!", "Well, so, let my death be on your conscience, and I\n\nbequeath you my Browning...\u2019\n\n\u2018The net, the net, the net...\u2019 was anxiously whispered around the cat.", "But\n\nthe net, devil knows why, got caught in someone\u2019s pocket and refused to\n\ncome out.", "\u2018The only thing that can save a mortally wounded cat,\u2019 said the cat, \u2018is a\n\nswig of benzene.\u2019 And taking advantage of the confusion, he bent to the\n\nround opening in the primus and had a good drink of benzene.", "The blood at\n\nonce stopped flowing from under his left front leg.", "The cat jumped up, alive\n\nand cheerful, seized the primus under his paw, shot back on to the\n\nmantelpiece with it, and from there, shredding the wallpaper, climbed the\n\nwall and some two seconds later was high above the visitors and sitting on a\n\nmetal curtain rod.", "Hands instantly clutched the curtain and tore it off together with the rod,\n\ncausing sunlight to flood the shaded room.", "But neither the fraudulently\n\nrecovered cat nor the primus fell down.", "The cat, without parting with his\n\nprimus, managed to shoot through the air and land on the chandelier\n\nhanging in the middle of the room.", "\u2018A stepladder!\u2019 came from below.", "\u2018I challenge you to a duel!\u2019 bawled the cat, sailing over their heads on the\n\nswinging chandelier, and the Browning was again in his paw, and the\n\nprimus was lodged among the branches of the chandelier.", "The cat took aim\n\nand, flying like a pendulum over the heads of the visitors, opened fire on\n\nthem.", "The din shook the apartment.", "Crystal shivers poured down from the\n\nchandelier, the mantelpiece mirror was cracked into stars, plaster dust flew,\n\nspent cartridges bounced over the floor, window-panes shattered, benzene\n\nspouted from the bullet-pierced primus.", "Now there was no question of\n\ntaking the cat alive, and the visitors fiercely and accurately returned his fire\n\nfrom the Mausers, aiming at his head, stomach, chest and back.", "The\n\nshooting caused panic on the asphalt courtyard.", "But this shooting did not last long and began to die down of itself.", "The\n\nthing was that it caused no harm either to the cat or to the visitors.", "Not only\n\nwas no one killed, but no one was even wounded.", "Everyone, including the\n\ncat, remained totally unharmed.", "One of the visitors, to verify it definitively,\n\nsent some five bullets at the confounded animal\u2019s head, while the cat\n\nsmartly responded with a full clip, but it was the same \u2014 no effect was\n\nproduced on anybody.", "The cat swayed on the chandelier, which swung less\n\nand less, blowing into the muzzle of his Browning and spitting on his paw\n\nfor some reason.", "The faces of those standing silently below acquired an expression of utter\n\nbewilderment.", "This was the only case, or one of the only cases, when\n\nshooting proved to be entirely inefficacious.", "One might allow, of course,\n\nthat the cat\u2019s Browning was some sort of toy, but one could by no means\n\nsay the same of the visitors\u2019 Mausers.", "The cat\u2019s very first wound \u2014 there\n\nobviously could not be the slightest doubt of it \u2014 was nothing but a trick\n\nand a swinish sham, as was the drinking of the benzene.", "One more attempt was made to get hold of the cat.", "The lasso was thrown,\n\nit caught on one of the candles, the chandelier fell down.", "The crash seemed\n\nto shake the whole structure of the house, but it was no use.", "Those present\n\nwere showered with splinters, and the cat flew through the air over them\n\nand settled high under the ceiling on the upper part of the mantelpiece\n\nmirror\u2019s gilded frame.", "He had no intention of escaping anywhere, but, on\n\nthe contrary, while sitting in relative safety, even started another speech:\n\n\u2018I utterly fail to comprehend,\u2019 he held forth from on high, \u2018the reasons for\n\nsuch harsh treatment of me ...\u2019\n\nAnd here at its very beginning this speech was interrupted by a heavy,\n\nlow voice coming from no one knew where:\n\n\u2018What\u2019s going on in the apartment?", "They prevent me from working ...\u2019\n\nAnother voice, unpleasant and nasal, responded:\n\n\u2018Well, it\u2019s Behemoth, of course, devil take him!\u2019\n\nA third, rattling voice said:\n\n\u2018Messire!", "It\u2019s Saturday.", "The sun is setting.", "Time to go.\u2019\n\n\u2018Excuse me, I can\u2019t talk any more,\u2019 the cat said from the mirror, \u2018time to\n\ngo.\u2019 He hurled his Browning and knocked out both panes in the window.", "Then he splashed down some benzene, and this benzene caught fire by\n\nitself, throwing a wave of flame up to the very ceiling.", "Things caught fire somehow unusually quickly and violently, as does not\n\nhappen even with benzene.", "The wallpaper at once began to smoke, the torn-\n\ndown curtain started burning on the floor, and the frames of the broken\n\nwindows began to smoulder.", "The cat crouched, miaowed, shot from the\n\nmirror to the window-sill, and disappeared through it together with his\n\nprimus.", "Shots rang out outside.", "A man sitting on the iron fire-escape at the\n\nlevel of the jeweller\u2019s wife\u2019s windows fired at the cat as he flew from one\n\nwindow-sill to another, making for the corner drainpipe of the house which,\n\nas has been said, was built in the form of a \u2018U\u2019.", "By way of this pipe, the cat\n\nclimbed up to the roof.", "There, unfortunately also without any result, he was\n\nshot at by the sentries guarding the chimneys, and the cat cleared off into\n\nthe setting sun that was flooding the city.", "Just then in the apartment the parquet blazed up under the visitors\u2019 feet,\n\nand in that fire, on the same spot where the cat had sprawled with his sham\n\nwound, there appeared, growing more and more dense, the corpse of the\n\nformer Baron Meigel with upthrust chin and glassy eyes.", "To get him out\n\nwas no longer possible.", "Leaping over the burning squares of parquet, slapping themselves on\n\ntheir smoking chests and shoulders, those who were in the living room\n\nretreated to the study and front hall.", "Those who were in the dining room and\n\nbedroom ran out through the corridor.", "Those in the kitchen also came\n\nrunning and rushed into the front hall.", "The living room was already filled\n\nwith fire and smoke.", "Someone managed, in flight, to dial the number of the\n\nfire department and shout briefly into the receiver:\n\n\u2018Sadovaya, three-oh-two-bis!", "...\u2019\n\nTo stay longer was impossible.", "Flames gushed out into the front hall.", "Breathing became difficult.", "As soon as the first little spurts of smoke pushed through the broken\n\nwindows of the enchanted apartment, desperate human cries arose in the\n\ncourtyard:\n\n\u2018Fire!", "Fire!", "We\u2019re burning!\u2019\n\nIn various apartments of the house, people began shouting into\n\ntelephones:\n\n\u2018Sadovaya!", "Sadovaya, three-oh-two-bis!\u2019\n\nJust then, as the heart-quailing bells were heard on Sadovaya, ringing\n\nfrom long red engines racing quickly from all parts of the city, the people\n\nrushing about the yard saw how, along with the smoke, there flew out of the\n\nfifth-storey window three dark, apparently male silhouettes and one\n\nsilhouette of a naked woman.", "CHAPTER 28\n\nThe Last Adventures of Koroviev and Behemoth\n\nWhether these silhouettes were there, or were only imagined by the fear-\n\nstruck tenants of the ill-fated house on Sadovaya, is, of course, impossible\n\nto say precisely.", "If they were there, where they set out for is also known to\n\nno one.", "Nor can we-say where they separated, but we do know that\n\napproximately a quarter of an hour after the fire started on Sadovaya, there\n\nappeared by the mirrored doors of a currency store1 on the Smolensky\n\nmarket-place a long citizen in a checkered suit, and with him a big black\n\ncat.", "Deftly slithering between the passers-by, the citizen opened the outer\n\ndoor of the shop.", "But here a small, bony and extremely ill-disposed\n\ndoorman barred his way and said irritably:\n\n\u2018No cats allowed!\u2019\n\n\u2018I beg your pardon,\u2019 rattled the long one, putting his gnarled hand to his\n\near as if he were hard of hearing, \u2018no cats, you say?", "And where do you see\n\nany cats?\u2019\n\nThe doorman goggled his eyes, and well he might: there was no cat at the\n\ncitizen\u2019s feet now, but instead, from behind his shoulder, a fat fellow in a\n\ntattered cap, whose mug indeed somewhat resembled a cat\u2018s, stuck out,\n\nstraining to get into the store.", "There was a primus in the fat fellow\u2019s hands.", "The misanthropic doorman for some reason disliked this pair of\n\ncustomers.", "\u2018We only accept currency,\u2019 he croaked, gazing vexedly from under his\n\nshaggy, as if moth-eaten, grizzled eyebrows.", "\u2018My dear man,\u2019 rattled the long one, flashing his eye through the broken\n\npince-nez, \u2018how do you know I don\u2019t have any?", "Are you judging by my\n\nclothes?", "Never do so, my most precious custodian!", "You may make a\n\nmistake, and a big one at that.", "At least read the story of the famous caliph\n\nHarun al-Rashid2 over again.", "But in the present case, casting that story\n\naside temporarily, I want to tell you that I am going to make a complaint\n\nabout you to the manager and tell him such tales about you that you may\n\nhave to surrender your post between the shining mirrored doors.\u2019\n\n\u2018Maybe I\u2019ve got a whole primus full of currency,\u2019 the cat-like fat fellow,\n\nwho was simply shoving his way into the store, vehemently butted into the\n\nconversation.", "Behind them the public was already pushing and getting angry.", "Looking\n\nat the prodigious pair with hatred and suspicion, the doorman stepped aside,\n\nand our acquaintances, Koroviev and Behemoth, found themselves in the\n\nstore.", "Here they first of all looked around, and then, in a ringing voice heard\n\ndecidedly in every comer, Koroviev announced:\n\n\u2018A wonderful store!", "A very, very fine store!\u2019\n\nThe public turned away from the counters and for some reason looked at\n\nthe speaker in amazement, though he had all grounds for praising the store.", "Hundreds of bolts of cotton in the richest assortment of colours could be\n\nseen in the pigeon-holes of the shelves.", "Next to them were piled calicoes,\n\nand chiffons, and flannels for suits.", "In receding perspective endless stacks\n\nof shoeboxes could be seen, and several citizenesses sat on little low chairs,\n\none foot shod in an old, worn-out shoe, the other in a shiny new pump,\n\nwhich they stamped on the carpet with a preoccupied air.", "Somewhere in the\n\ndepths, around a comer, gramophones sang and played music.", "But, bypassing all these enchantments, Koroviev and Behemoth made\n\nstraight for the junction of the grocery and confectionery departments.", "Here\n\nthere was plenty of room, no citizenesses in scarves and little berets were\n\npushing against the counters, as in the fabric department.", "A short, perfectly square man with blue shaven jowls, horn-rimmed\n\nglasses, a brand-new hat, not crumpled and with no sweat stains on the\n\nband, in a lilac coat and orange kid gloves, stood by the counter grunting\n\nsomething peremptorily.", "A sales clerk in a clean white smock and a blue hat\n\nwas waiting on the lilac client.", "With the sharpest of knives, much like the\n\nknife stolen by Matthew Levi, he was removing from a weeping, plump\n\npink salmon its snake-like, silvery skin.", "\u2018This department is splendid, too,\u2019 Koroviev solemnly acknowledged,\n\n\u2018and the foreigner is a likeable fellow,\u2019 he benevolently pointed his finger at\n\nthe lilac back.", "\u2018No, Fagott, no,\u2019 Behemoth replied pensively, \u2018you\u2019re mistaken, my\n\nfriend: the lilac gentleman\u2019s face lacks something, in my opinion.\u2019\n\nThe lilac back twitched, but probably by chance, for the foreigner was\n\nsurely unable to understand what Koroviev and his companion were saying\n\nin Russian.", "\u2018Is good?\u2019 the lilac purchaser asked sternly.", "\u2018Top-notch!\u2019 replied the sales clerk, cockily slipping the edge of the knife\n\nunder the skin.", "\u2018Good I like, bad I don\u2019t,\u2018 the foreigner said sternly.", "\u2018Right you are!\u2019 the sales clerk rapturously replied.", "Here our acquaintances walked away from the foreigner and his salmon\n\nto the end of the confectionery counter.", "\u2018It\u2019s hot today,\u2019 Koroviev addressed a young, red-cheeked salesgirl and\n\nreceived no reply to his words.", "\u2018How much are the mandarins?\u2019 Koroviev\n\nthen inquired of her.", "\u2018Fifteen kopecks a pound,\u2019 replied the salesgirl.", "\u2018Everything\u2019s so pricey,\u2019 Koroviev observed with a sigh, \u2018hm ... hm ...\u2019\n\nHe thought a little longer and then invited his companion: \u2018Eat up,\n\nBehemoth.\u2019\n\nThe fat fellow put his primus under his arm, laid hold of the top mandarin\n\non the pyramid, straight away gobbled it up skin and all, and began on a\n\nsecond.", "The salesgirl was overcome with mortal terror.", "\u2018You\u2019re out of your mind!\u2019 she shouted, losing her colour.", "\u2018Give me the\n\nreceipt!", "The receipt!\u2019 and she dropped the confectionery tongs.", "\u2018My darling, my dearest, my beauty,\u2019 Koroviev rasped, leaning over the\n\ncounter and winking at the salesgirl, \u2018we\u2019re out of currency today ... what\n\ncan we do?", "But I swear to you, by next time, and no later than Monday,\n\nwe\u2019ll pay it all in pure cash!", "We\u2019re from near by, on Sadovaya, where\n\nthey\u2019re having the fire ...\u2019\n\nBehemoth, after swallowing a third mandarin, put his paw into a clever\n\nconstruction of chocolate bars, pulled out the bottom one, which of course\n\nmade the whole thing collapse, and swallowed it together with its gold\n\nwrapper.", "The sales clerks behind the fish counter stood as if petrified, their knives\n\nin their hands, the lilac foreigner swung around to the robbers, and here it\n\nturned out that Behemoth was mistaken: there was nothing lacking in the\n\nlilac one\u2019s face, but, on the contrary, rather some superfluity of hanging\n\njowls and furtive eyes.", "Turning completely yellow, the salesgirl anxiously cried for the whole\n\nstore to hear:\n\n\u2018Palosich!", "3 Palosich!\u2019\n\nThe public from the fabric department came thronging at this cry, while\n\nBehemoth, stepping away from the confectionery temptations, thrust his\n\npaw into a barrel labelled \u2018Choice Kerch Herring\u2019, 4 pulled out a couple of\n\nherring, and swallowed them, spitting out the tails.", "\u2018Palosich!\u2019 the desperate cry came again from behind the confectionery\n\ncounter, and from behind the fish counter a sales clerk with a goatee barked:\n\n\u2018What\u2019s this you\u2019re up to, vermin?\u2019\n\nPavel Yosifovich was already hastening to the scene of the action.", "He\n\nwas an imposing man in a clean white smock, like a surgeon, with a pencil\n\nsticking out of the pocket.", "Pavel Yosifovich was obviously an experienced\n\nman.", "Seeing the tail of the third herring in Behemoth\u2019s mouth, he instantly\n\nassessed the situation, understood decidedly everything, and, without\n\ngetting into any arguments with the insolent louts, waved his arm into the\n\ndistance, commanding:\n\n\u2018Whistle!\u2019\n\nThe doorman flew from the mirrored door out to the comer of the\n\nSmolensky market-place and dissolved in a sinister whistling.", "The public\n\nbegan to surround the blackguards, and then Koroviev stepped into the\n\naffair.", "\u2018Citizens!\u2019 he called out in a high, vibrating voice, \u2018what\u2019s going on\n\nhere?", "Eh?", "Allow me to ask you that!", "The poor man\u2019 \u2014 Koroviev let some\n\ntremor into his voice and pointed to Behemoth, who immediately concocted\n\na woeful physiognomy \u2014 \u2019the poor man spends all day reparating\n\nprimuses.", "He got hungry ... and where\u2019s he going to get currency?\u2018\n\nTo this Pavel Yosifovich, usually restrained and calm, shouted sternly:\n\n\u2018You just stop that!\u2019 and waved into the distance, impatiently now.", "Then\n\nthe trills by the door resounded more merrily.", "But Koroviev, unabashed by Pavel Yosifovich\u2019s pronouncement, went\n\non:\n\n\u2018Where?", "\u2014 I ask you all this question!", "He\u2019s languishing with hunger and\n\nthirst, he\u2019s hot.", "So the hapless fellow took and sampled a mandarin.", "And the\n\ntotal worth of that mandarin is three kopecks.", "And here they go whistling\n\nlike spring nightingales in the woods, bothering the police, tearing them\n\naway from their business.", "But he\u2019s allowed, eh?\u2019 and here Koroviev pointed\n\nto the lilac fat man, which caused the strongest alarm to appear on his face.", "\u2018Who is he?", "Eh?", "Where did he come from?", "And why?", "Couldn\u2019t we do\n\nwithout him?", "Did we invite him, or what?", "Of course,\u2019 the ex-choirmaster\n\nbawled at the top of his lungs, twisting his mouth sarcastically, \u2018just look at\n\nhim, in his smart lilac suit, all swollen with salmon, all stuffed with\n\ncurrency \u2014 and us, what about the likes of us?!", "...

deceptions vanished, fell into the swamp, the unstable magic garments\n\ndrowned in the mists.", "Hardly recognizable as Koroviev-Fagott, the self-appointed interpreter to\n\nthe mysterious consultant

to the\n\nwhistling of the wind.", "This knight once made an unfortunate joke,\u2018 replied Woland, turning his\n\nface with its quietly burning eye to Margarita.", "\u2019The pun he thought up, in a\n\ndiscussion about light and darkness, was not altogether good.", "And after that\n\nthe knight had to go on joking a bit more and longer than he supposed.", "But\n\nthis is one of the nights when accounts are settled.", "The knight has paid up\n\nand closed his account.\u2018\n\nNight also tore off Behemoth\u2019s fluffy tail, pulled off his fur and scattered\n\nit in tufts over the swamps.", "He who had been a cat, entertaining the prince\n\nof darkness, now turned out to be a slim youth, a demon-page, the best\n\njester the world has ever seen.", "Now he, too, grew quiet and flew noiselessly,\n\nsetting his young face towards the light that streamed from the moon.", "At the far side, the steel of his armour glittering, flew Azazello.", "The\n\nmoon also changed his face.", "The absurd, ugly fang disappeared without a\n\ntrace, and the albugo on his eye proved false.", "Azazello\u2019s eyes were both the\n\nsame, empty and black, and his face was white and cold.", "Now Azazello\n\nflew in his true form, as the demon of the waterless desert, the killer-demon.", "Margarita could not see herself, but she saw very well how the master\n\nhad changed.", "His hair was now white in the moonlight and gathered behind\n\nin a braid, and it flew on the wind.", "When the wind blew the cloak away\n\nfrom the master\u2019s legs, Margarita saw the stars of spurs on his jackboots,\n\nnow going out, now lighting up.", "Like the demon-youth, the master flew\n\nwith his eyes fixed on the moon, yet smiling to it, as to a close and beloved\n\nfriend, and, from a habit acquired in room no.", "118, murmuring something to\n\nhimself.", "And, finally, Woland also flew in his true image.", "Margarita could not\n\nhave said what his horse\u2019s bridle was made of, but thought it might be\n\nchains of moonlight, and the horse itself was a mass of darkness, and the\n\nhorse\u2019s mane a storm cloud, and the rider\u2019s spurs the white flecks of stars.", "Thus they flew in silence for a long time, until the place itself began to\n\nchange below them.", "The melancholy forests drowned in earthly darkness\n\nand drew with them the dim blades of the rivers.", "Boulders appeared and\n\nbegan to gleam below, with black gaps between them where the moonlight\n\ndid not penetrate.", "Woland reined in his horse on a stony, joyless, flat summit, and the riders\n\nthen proceeded at a walk, listening to the crunch of flint and stone under the\n\nhorses\u2019 shoes.", "Moonlight flooded the platform greenly and brightly, and\n\nsoon Margarita made out an armchair in this deserted place and in it the\n\nwhite figure of a seated man.", "Possibly the seated man was deaf, or else too\n\nsunk in his own thoughts.", "He did not hear the stony earth shudder under the\n\nhorses\u2019 weight, and the riders approached him without disturbing him.", "The moon helped Margarita well, it shone better than the best electric\n\nlantern, and Margarita saw that the seated man, whose eyes seemed blind,\n\nrubbed his hands fitfully, and peered with those same unseeing eyes at the\n\ndisc of the moon.", "Now Margarita saw that beside the heavy stone chair, on\n\nwhich sparks glittered in the moonlight, lay a dark, huge, sharp-eared dog,\n\nand, like its master, it gazed anxiously at the moon.", "Pieces of a broken jug\n\nwere scattered by the seated man\u2019s feet and an undrying black-red puddle\n\nspread there.", "The riders stopped their horses.", "\u2018Your novel has been read,\u2019 Woland began, turning to the master, \u2018and the\n\nonly thing said about it was that, unfortunately, it is not finished.", "So, then, I\n\nwanted to show you your hero.", "For about two thousand years he has been\n\nsitting on this platform and sleeping, but when the full moon comes, as you\n\nsee, he is tormented by insomnia.", "It torments not only him, but also his\n\nfaithful guardian, the dog.", "If it is true that cowardice is the most grievous\n\nvice, then the dog at least is not guilty of it.", "Storms were the only thing the\n\nbrave dog feared.", "Well, he who loves must share the lot of the one he\n\nloves.\u2019\n\n\u2018What is he saying?\u2019 asked Margarita, and her perfectly calm face\n\nclouded over with compassion.", "\u2018He says one and the same thing,\u2019 Woland replied.", "\u2018He says that even the\n\nmoon gives him no peace, and that his is a bad job.", "That is what he always\n\nsays when he is not asleep, and when he sleeps, he dreams one and the same\n\nthing: there is a path of moonlight, and he wants to walk down it and talk\n\nwith the prisoner Ha-Nozri, because, as he insists, he never finished what he\n\nwas saying that time, long ago, on the fourteenth day of the spring month of\n\nNisan.", "But, alas, for some reason he never manages to get on to this path,\n\nand no one comes to him.", "Then there\u2019s no help for it, he must talk to\n\nhimself.", "However, one does need some diversity, and to his talk about the\n\nmoon he often adds that of all things in the world, he most hates his\n\nimmortality and his unheard-of fame.", "He maintains that he would willingly\n\nexchange his lot for that of the ragged tramp Matthew Levi.\u2019\n\n\u2018Twelve thousand moons for one moon long ago, isn\u2019t that too much?\u2019\n\nasked Margarita.",

on\n\nthat.\u2019\n\n\u2018Let him go!\u2019 Margarita suddenly cried piercingly, as she had cried once\n\nas a witch, and at this cry a stone fell somewhere in the mountains and\n\ntumbled down the ledges into the abyss, filling the mountains with\n\nrumbling.", "But Margarita could not have said whether it was the rumbling of\n\nits fall or the rumbling of satanic laughter.", "In any case, Woland was\n\nlaughing as he glanced at Margarita and said:\n\n\u2018Don\u2019t shout in the mountains, he\u2019s accustomed to avalanches anyway,\n\nand it won\u2019t rouse him.", "You don\u2019t need to ask for him, Margarita, because\n\nthe one he so yearns to talk with has already asked for him.\u2019 Here Woland\n\nturned to the master and said: \u2018Well, now you can finish your novel with\n\none phrase!\u2019\n\nThe master seemed to have been expecting this, as he stood motionless\n\nand looked at the seated procurator.", "He cupped his hands to his mouth and\n\ncried out so that the echo leaped over the unpeopled and unforested\n\nmountains:\n\n\u2018You\u2019re free!", "You\u2019re free!", "He\u2019s waiting for you!\u2019\n\nThe mountains turned the master\u2019s voice to thunder, and by this same\n\nthunder they were destroyed.", "The accursed rocky walls collapsed.", "Only the\n\nplatform with the stone armchair remained.", "Over the black abyss into which\n\nthe walls had gone, a boundless city lit up, dominated by gleaming idols\n\nabove a garden grown luxuriously over many thousands of moons.", "The path\n\nof moonlight so long awaited by the procurator stretched right to this\n\ngarden, and the first to rush down it was the sharp-eared dog.", "The man in\n\nthe white cloak with blood-red lining rose from the armchair and shouted\n\nsomething in a hoarse, cracked voice.", "It was impossible to tell whether he\n\nwas weeping or laughing, or what he shouted.", "It could only be seen that,\n\nfollowing his faithful guardian, he, too, rushed headlong down the path of\n\nmoonlight.", "\u2018I\u2019m to follow him there?\u2019 the master asked anxiously, holding the bridle.", "\u2018No,\u2019 replied Woland, \u2018why run after what is already finished?\u2019\n\n\u2018There, then?\u2019 the master asked, turning and pointing back, where the\n\nrecently abandoned city with the gingerbread towers of its convent, with the\n\nsun broken to smithereens in its windows, now wove itself behind them.", "\u2018Not there, either,\u2019 replied Woland, and his voice thickened and flowed\n\nover the rocks.", "\u2018Romantic master!", "He, whom the hero you invented and\n\nhave just set free so yearns to see, has read your novel.\u2019 Here Woland\n\nturned to Margarita: \u2018Margarita Nikolaevna!", "It is impossible not to believe\n\nthat you have tried to think up the best future for the master, but, really,\n\nwhat I am offering you, and what Yeshua has asked for you, is better still!", "Leave them to each other,\u2019 Woland said, leaning towards the master\u2019s\n\nsaddle from his own, pointing to where the procurator had gone, \u2018let\u2019s not\n\ninterfere with them.", "And maybe they\u2019ll still arrive at something.\u2019 Here\n\nWoland waved his arm in the direction of Yershalaim, and it went out.", "\u2018And there, too,\u2019 Woland pointed behind them, \u2018what are you going to do\n\nin the little basement?\u2019 Here the sun broken up in the glass went out.", "\u2018Why?\u2019 Woland went on persuasively and gently, \u2018oh, thrice-romantic\n\nmaster, can it be that you don\u2019t want to go strolling with your friend in the\n\ndaytime under cherry trees just coming into bloom, and in the evening listen\n\nto Schubert\u2019s music?", "Can it be that you won\u2019t like writing with a goose quill\n\nby candlelight?", "Can it be that you don\u2019t want to sit over a retort like Faust,\n\nin hopes that you\u2019ll succeed in forming a new homunculus?", "There!", "There!", "The house and the old servant are already waiting for you, the candles are\n\nalready burning, and soon they will go out, because you will immediately\n\nmeet the dawn.", "Down this path, master, this one!", "Farewell!", "It\u2019s time for me\n\nto go!\u2019\n\n\u2018Farewell!\u2019 Margarita and the master answered Woland in one cry.", "Then\n\nthe black Woland, heedless of any road, threw himself into a gap, and his\n\nretinue noisily hurtled down after him.", "There were no rocks, no platform,\n\nno path of moonlight, no Yershalaim around.", "The black steeds also\n\nvanished.", "The master and Margarita saw the promised dawn.", "It began\n\nstraight away, immediately after the midnight moon.", "The master walked\n\nwith his friend in the brilliance of the first rays of morning over a mossy\n\nlittle stone bridge.", "They crossed it.", "The faithful lovers left the stream behind\n\nand walked down the sandy path.", "\u2018Listen to the stillness,\u2019 Margarita said to the master, and the sand rustled\n\nunder her bare feet, \u2018listen and enjoy what you were not given in life \u2014\n\npeace.", "Look, there ahead is your eternal home, which you have been given\n\nas a reward.", "I can already see the Venetian window and the twisting vine, it\n\nclimbs right up to the roof.", "Here is your home, your eternal home.", "I know\n\nthat in the evenings you will be visited by those you love, those who\n\ninterest you and who will never trouble you.", "They will play for you, they\n\nwill sing for you, you will see what light is in the room when the candles\n\nare burning.", "You will fall asleep, having put on your greasy and eternal\n\nnightcap, you will fall asleep with a smile on your lips.", "Sleep will\n\nstrengthen you, you will reason wisely.", "And you will no longer be able to\n\ndrive me away.", "I will watch over your sleep.\u2019\n\nThus spoke Margarita, walking with the master to their eternal home, and\n\nit seemed to the master that Margarita\u2019s words flowed in the same way as\n\nthe stream they had left behind flowed and whispered, and the master\u2019s\n\nmemory, the master\u2019s anxious, needled memory began to fade.", "Someone\n\nwas setting the master free, as he himself had just set free the hero he had\n\ncreated.", "This hero had gone into the abyss, gone irrevocably, the son of the\n\nastrologer-king, forgiven on the eve of Sunday, the cruel fifth procurator of\n\nJudea, the equestrian Pontius Pilate.", "Epilogue\n\nBut all the same \u2014 what happened later in Moscow, after that Saturday\n\nevening when Woland left the capital, having disappeared from Sparrow\n\nHills at sunset with his retinue?", "Of the fact that, for a long time, a dense hum of the most incredible\n\nrumours went all over the capital and very quickly spread to remote and\n\nforsaken provincial places as well, nothing need be said.", "It is even\n\nnauseating to repeat such rumours.", "The writer of these truthful lines himself, personally, on a trip to\n\nFeodosiya, heard a story on the train about two thousand persons in\n\nMoscow coming out of a theatre stark-naked in the literal sense of the word\n\nand in that fashion returning home in taxi-cabs.", "The whisper \u2018unclean powers\u2019 was heard in queues waiting at dairy\n\nstores, in tram-cars, shops, apartments, kitchens, on trains both suburban\n\nand long-distance, in stations big and small, at summer resorts and on\n\nbeaches.", "The most developed and cultured people, to be sure, took no part in this\n\ntale-telling about the unclean powers that had visited Moscow, even\n\nlaughed at them and tried to bring the tellers to reason.", "But all the same a\n\nfact, as they say, is a fact, and to brush it aside without explanations is\n\nsimply impossible: someone had visited the capital.", "The nice little cinders\n\nleft over from Griboedov\u2018s, and many other things as well, confirmed that\n\nonly too eloquently.", "Cultured people adopted the view of the investigation: it had been the\n\nwork of a gang of hypnotists and ventriloquists with a superb command of\n\ntheir art.", "Measures for catching them, in Moscow as well as outside it, were of\n\ncourse immediately and energetically taken, but, most regrettably, produced\n\nno results.", "The one calling himself Woland disappeared with all his\n\ncompany and neither returned to Moscow nor appeared anywhere else, and\n\ndid not manifest himself in any way.", "Quite naturally, the suggestion\n\nemerged that he had fled abroad, but there, too, he gave no signs of himself.", "The investigation of his case continued for a long time.", "Because, in truth,\n\nit was a monstrous case!", "Not to mention four burned-down buildings and\n\nhundreds of people driven mad, there had been murders.", "Of two this could\n\nbe said with certainty: of Berlioz, and of that ill-fated employee of the\n\nbureau for acquainting foreigners with places of interest in Moscow, the\n\nformer Baron Meigel.", "They had been murdered.", "The charred bones of the\n\nlatter were discovered in apartment no.", "50 on Sadovaya Street after the fire\n\nwas put out.", "Yes, there were victims, and these victims called for\n\ninvestigation.", "But there were other victims as well, even after Woland left the capital,\n\nand these victims, sadly enough, were black cats.", "Approximately a hundred of these peaceful and useful animals, devoted\n\nto mankind, were shot or otherwise exterminated in various parts of the\n\ncountry.", "About a dozen cats, some badly disfigured, were delivered to\n\npolice stations in various cities.", "For instance, in Armavir one of these\n\nperfectly guiltless beasts was brought to the police by some citizen with its\n\nfront paws tied.", "This cat had been ambushed by the citizen at the very moment when the\n\nanimal, with a thievish look (how can it be helped if cats have this look?", "It\n\nis not because they are depraved, but because they are afraid lest some\n\nbeings stronger than themselves \u2014 dogs or people \u2014 cause them some\n\nharm or offence.", "Both are very easy to do, but I assure you there is no credit\n\nin doing so, no, none at all!", "), so, then, with a thievish look the cat was for\n\nsome reason about to dash into the burdock.", "Falling upon the cat and tearing his necktie off to bind it, the citizen\n\nmuttered venomously and threateningly:\n\n\u2018Aha!", "So now you\u2019ve been so good as to come to our Armavir, mister\n\nhypnotist?", "Well, we\u2019re not afraid of you here.", "Don\u2019t pretend to be dumb!", "We know what kind of goose you are!\u2019\n\nThe citizen brought the cat to the police, dragging the poor beast by its\n\nfront paws, bound with a green necktie, giving it little kicks to make the cat\n\nwalk not otherwise than on its hind legs.", "\u2018You quit that,\u2019 cried the citizen, accompanied by whistling boys, \u2018quit\n\nplaying the fool!", "It won\u2019t do!", "Kindly walk like everybody else!\u2019\n\nThe black cat only rolled its martyred eyes.", "Being deprived by nature of\n\nthe gift of speech, it could not vindicate itself in any way.", "The poor beast\n\nowed its salvation first of all to the police, and then to its owner \u2014 a\n\nvenerable old widow.", "As soon as the cat was delivered to the police station,\n\nit was realized that the citizen smelled rather strongly of alcohol, as a result\n\nof which his evidence was at once subject to doubt.", "And the little old lady,\n\nhaving meanwhile learned from neighbours that her cat had been hauled in,\n\nrushed to the station and arrived in the nick of time.", "She gave the most\n\nflattering references for the cat, explained that she had known it for five\n\nyears, since it was a kitten, that she vouched for it as for her own self, and\n\nproved that it had never been known to do anything bad and had never been\n\nto Moscow.", "As it had been born in Armavir, so there it had grown up and\n\nlearned the catching of mice.", "The cat was untied and returned to its owner, having tasted grief, it\u2019s true,\n\nand having learned by experience the meaning of error and slander.", "Besides cats, some minor unpleasantnesses befell certain persons.", "Detained for a short time were: in Leningrad, the citizens Wolman and\n\nWolper; in Saratov, Kiev and Kharkov, three Volodins; in Kazan, one\n\nVolokh; and in Penza \u2014 this for totally unknown reasons - doctor of\n\nchemical sciences Vetchinkevich.", "True, he was enormously tall, very\n\nswarthy and dark-haired.", "In various places, besides that, nine Korovins, four Korovkins and two\n\nKaravaevs were caught.", "A certain citizen was taken off the Sebastopol train and bound at the\n\nBelgorod station.", "This citizen had decided to entertain his fellow passengers\n\nwith card tricks.", "In Yaroslavl, a citizen came to a restaurant at lunch-time carrying a\n\nprimus which he had just picked up from being repaired.", "The moment they\n\nsaw him, the two doormen abandoned their posts in the coatroom and fled,\n\nand after them fled all the restaurant\u2019s customers and personnel.", "With that,\n\nin some inexplicable fashion, the girl at the cash register had all the money\n\ndisappear on her.", "There was much else, but one cannot remember everything.", "Again and again justice must be done to the investigation.", "Every attempt\n\nwas made not only to catch the criminals, but to explain all their mischief.", "And it all was explained, and these explanations cannot but be\n\nacknowledged as sensible and irrefutable.", "Representatives of the investigation and experienced psychiatrists\n\nestablished that members of the criminal gang, or one of them perhaps\n\n(suspicion fell mainly on Koroviev), were hypnotists of unprecedented\n\npower, who could show themselves not in the place where they actually\n\nwere, but in imaginary, shifted positions.", "Along with that, they could freely\n\nsuggest to those they encountered that certain things or people were where\n\nthey actually were not, and, contrariwise, could remove from the field of\n\nvision things or people that were in fact to be found within that field of\n\nvision.", "In the light of such explanations, decidedly everything was clear, even\n\nwhat the citizens found most troublesome, the apparently quite inexplicable\n\ninvulnerability of the cat, shot at in apartment no.", "50 during the attempt to\n\nput him under arrest.", "There had been no cat on the chandelier, naturally, nor had anyone even\n\nthought of returning their fire, the shooters had been aiming at an empty\n\nspot, while Koroviev, having suggested that the cat was acting up on the\n\nchandelier, was free to stand behind the shooters\u2019 backs, mugging and\n\nenjoying his enormous, albeit criminally employed, capacity for suggestion.", "It was he, of course, who had set fire to the apartment by spilling the\n\nbenzene.", "Styopa Likhodeev had, of course, never gone to any Yalta (such a stunt\n\nwas beyond even Koroviev\u2019s powers), nor had he sent any telegrams from\n\nthere.", "After fainting in the jeweller\u2019s wife\u2019s apartment, frightened by a trick\n\nof Koroviev\u2018s, who had shown him a cat holding a pickled mushroom on a\n\nfork, he lay there until Koroviev, jeering at him, capped him with a shaggy\n\nfelt hat and sent him to the Moscow airport, having first suggested to the\n\nrepresentatives of the investigation who went to meet Styopa that Styopa\n\nwould be getting off the plane from Sebastopol.", "True, the criminal investigation department in Yalta maintained that they\n\nhad received the barefoot Styopa, and had sent telegrams concerning Styopa\n\nto Moscow, but no copies of these telegrams were found in the files, from\n\nwhich the sad but absolutely invincible conclusion was drawn that the\n\nhypnotizing gang was able to hypnotize at an enormous distance, and not\n\nonly individual persons but even whole groups of them.", "Under these circumstances, the criminals were able to drive people of the\n\nmost sturdy psychic make-up out of their minds.", "To say nothing of such\n\ntrifles as the pack of cards in the pocket of someone in the stalls, the\n\nwomen\u2019s disappearing dresses, or the miaowing beret, or other things of\n\nthat sort!", "Such stunts can be pulled by any professional hypnotist of average\n\nability on any stage, including the uncomplicated trick of tearing the head\n\noff the master of ceremonies.", "The talking cat was also sheer nonsense.", "To\n\npresent people with such a cat, it is enough to have a command of the basic\n\nprinciples of ventriloquism, and scarcely anyone will doubt that Koroviev\u2019s\n\nart went significantly beyond those principles.", "Yes, the point here lay not at all in packs of cards, or the false letters in\n\nNikanor Ivanovich\u2019s briefcase!", "These were all trifles!", "It was he, Koroviev,\n\nwho had sent Berlioz to certain death under the tram-car.", "It was he who had\n\ndriven the poor poet Ivan Homeless crazy, he who had made him have\n\nvisions, see ancient Yershalaim in tormenting dreams, and sun-scorched,\n\nwaterless Bald Mountain with three men hanging on posts.", "It was he and his\n\ngang who had made Margarita Nikolaevna and her housekeeper Natasha\n\ndisappear from Moscow.", "Incidentally, the investigation considered this\n\nmatter with special attention.", "It had to find out if the two women had been\n\nabducted by the gang of murderers and arsonists or had fled voluntarily\n\nwith the criminal company.", "On the basis of the absurd and incoherent\n\nevidence of Nikolai Ivanovich, and considering the strange and insane note\n\nMargarita Nikolaevna had left for her husband, the note in which she wrote\n\nthat she had gone off to become a witch, as well as the circumstance that\n\nNatasha had disappeared leaving all her clothes behind, the investigation\n\nconcluded that both mistress and housekeeper, like many others, had been\n\nhypnotized, and had thus been abducted by the band.", "There also emerged\n\nthe probably quite correct thought that the criminals had been attracted by\n\nthe beauty of the two women.", "Yet what remained completely unclear to the investigation was the gang\u2019s\n\nmotive in abducting the mental patient who called himself the master from\n\nthe psychiatric clinic.", "This they never succeeded in establishing, nor did\n\nthey succeed in obtaining the abducted man\u2019s last name.", "Thus he vanished\n\nfor ever under the dead alias of number one-eighteen from the first building.", "And so, almost everything was explained, and the investigation came to\n\nan end, as everything generally comes to an end.", "Several years passed, and the citizens began to forget Woland, Koroviev\n\nand the rest.", "Many changes took place in the lives of those who suffered\n\nfrom Woland and his company, and however trifling and insignificant those\n\nchanges are, they still ought to be noted.", "Georges Bengalsky, for instance, after spending three months in the\n\nclinic, recovered and left it, but had to give up his work at the Variety, and\n\nthat at the hottest time, when the public was flocking after tickets: the\n\nmemory of black magic and its exposure proved very tenacious.", "Bengalsky\n\nleft the Variety, for he understood that to appear every night before two\n\nthousand people, to be inevitably recognized and endlessly subjected to\n\njeering questions of how he liked it better, with or without his head, was\n\nmuch too painful.", "And, besides that, the master of ceremonies had lost a considerable dose\n\nof his gaiety, which is so necessary in his profession.", "He remained with the\n\nunpleasant, burdensome habit of falling, every spring during the full moon,\n\ninto a state of anxiety, suddenly clutching his neck, looking around fearfully\n\nand weeping.", "These fits would pass, but all the same, since he had them, he\n\ncould not continue in his former occupation, and so the master of\n\nceremonies retired and started living on his savings, which, by his modest\n\nreckoning, were enough to last him fifteen years.", "He left and never again met Varenukha, who has gained universal\n\npopularity and affection by his responsiveness and politeness, incredible\n\neven among theatre administrators.", "The free-pass seekers, for instance,\n\nnever refer to him otherwise than as father-benefactor.", "One can call the\n\nVariety at any time and always hear in the receiver a soft but sad voice:\n\n\u2018May I help you?\u2019 And to the request that Varenukha be called to the phone,\n\nthe same voice hastens to answer: \u2018At your service.\u2019 And, oh, how Ivan\n\nSavelyevich has suffered from his own politeness!", "Styopa Likhodeev was to talk no more over the phone at the Variety.", "Immediately after his release from the clinic, where he spent eight days,\n\nStyopa was transferred to Rostov, taking up the position of manager of a\n\nlarge food store.", "Rumour has it that he has stopped drinking cheap wine\n\naltogether and drinks only vodka with blackcurrant buds, which has greatly\n\nimproved his health.", "They say he has become taciturn and keeps away from\n\nwomen.", "The removal of Stepan Bogdanovich from the Variety did not bring\n\nRimsky the joy of which he had been so greedily dreaming over the past\n\nseveral years.", "After the clinic and Kislovodsk, old, old as could be, his head\n\nwagging, the findirector submitted a request to be dismissed from the\n\nVariety.", "The interesting thing was that this request was brought to the\n\nVariety by Rimsky\u2019s wife.", "Grigory Danilovich himself found it beyond his\n\nstrength to visit, even during the daytime, the building where he had seen\n\nthe cracked window-pane flooded with moonlight and the long arm making\n\nits way to the lower latch.", "Having left the Variety, the findirector took a job with a children\u2019s\n\nmarionette theatre in Zamoskvorechye.", "In this theatre he no longer had to\n\nrun into the much esteemed Arkady Apollonovich Sempleyarov on matters\n\nof acoustics.", "The latter had been promptly transferred to Briansk and\n\nappointed manager of a mushroom cannery.", "The Muscovites now eat salted\n\nand pickled mushrooms and cannot praise them enough, and they rejoice\n\nexceedingly over this transfer.", "Since it is a bygone thing, we may now say\n\nthat Arkady Apollonovich\u2019s relations with acoustics never worked out very\n\nwell, and as they had been, so they remained, no matter how he tried to\n\nimprove them.", "Among persons who have broken with the theatre, apart from Arkady\n\nApollonovich, mention should be made of Nikanor Ivanovich Bosoy,\n\nthough he had been connected with the theatre in no other way than by his\n\nlove for free tickets.", "Nikanor Ivanovich not only goes to no sort of theatre,\n\neither paying or free, but even changes countenance at any theatrical\n\nconversation.", "Besides the theatre, he has come to hate, not to a lesser but to\n\na still greater degree, the poet Pushkin and the talented actor Sawa\n\nPotapovich Kurolesov.", "The latter to such a degree that last year, seeing a\n\nblack-framed announcement in the newspaper that Sawa Potapovich had\n\nsuffered a stroke in the full bloom of his career, Nikanor Ivanovich turned\n\nso purple that he almost followed after Sawa Potapovich, and bellowed:\n\n\u2018Serves him right!\u2019 Moreover, that same evening Nikanor Ivanovich, in\n\nwhom the death of the popular actor had evoked a great many painful\n\nmemories, alone, in the sole company of the full moon shining on\n\nSadovaya, got terribly drunk.", "And with each drink, the cursed line of\n\nhateful figures got longer, and in this line were Dunchil, Sergei\n\nGerardovich, and the beautiful Ida Herculanovna, and that red-haired owner\n\nof fighting geese, and the candid Kanavkin, Nikolai.", "Well, and what on earth happened to them?", "Good heavens!", "Precisely\n\nnothing happened to them, or could happen, since they never actually\n\nexisted, as that affable artiste, the master of ceremonies, never existed, nor\n\nthe theatre itself, nor that old pinchfist of an aunt Porokhovnikova, who\n\nkept currency rotting in the cellar, and there certainly were no golden\n\ntrumpets or impudent cooks.", "All this Nikanor Ivanovich merely dreamed\n\nunder the influence of the nasty Koroviev.", "The only living person to fly into\n\nthis dream was precisely Savva Potapovich, the actor, and he got mixed up\n\nin it only because he was ingrained in Nikanor Ivanovich\u2019s memory owing\n\nto his frequent performances on the radio.", "He existed, but the rest did not.", "So, maybe Aloisy Mogarych did not exist either?", "Oh, no!", "He not only\n\nexisted, but he exists even now and precisely in the post given up by\n\nRimsky, that is, the post of findirector of the Variety.", "Coming to his senses about twenty-four hours after his visit to Woland,\n\non a train somewhere near Vyatka, Aloisy realized that, having for some\n\nreason left Moscow in a darkened state of mind, he had forgotten to put on\n\nhis trousers, but instead had stolen, with an unknown purpose, the\n\ncompletely useless household register of the builder.", "Paying a colossal sum\n\nof money to the conductor, Aloisy acquired from him an old and greasy pair\n\nof pants, and in Vyatka he turned back.", "But, alas, he did not find the\n\nbuilder\u2019s little house.", "The decrepit trash had been licked clean away by a\n\nfire.", "But Aloisy was an extremely enterprising man.", "Two weeks later he was\n\nliving in a splendid room on Briusovsky Lane, and a few months later he\n\nwas sitting in Rimsky\u2019s office.", "And as Rimsky had once suffered because of\n\nStyopa, so now Varenukha was tormented because of Aloisy.", "Ivan\n\nSavelyevich\u2019s only dream is that this Aloisy should be removed somewhere\n\nout of sight, because, as Varenukha sometimes whispers in intimate\n\ncompany, he supposedly has never in his life met \u2018such scum as this\n\nAloisy\u2019, and he supposedly expects anything you like from this Aloisy.", "However, the administrator is perhaps prejudiced.", "Aloisy has not been\n\nknown for any shady business, or for any business at all, unless of course\n\nwe count his appointing someone else to replace the barman Sokov.", "For\n\nAndrei Fokich died of liver cancer in the clinic of the First MSU some ten\n\nmonths after Woland\u2019s appearance in Moscow.", "Yes, several years have passed, and the events truthfully described in this\n\nbook have healed over and faded from memory.", "But not for everyone, not\n\nfor everyone.", "Each year, with the festal spring full moon,1 a man of about thirty or thirty-odd appears towards evening under the lindens at the Patriarch\u2019s\n\nPonds.", "A

sits down on the same bench on\n\nwhich he sat that evening when Berlioz, long forgotten by all, saw the moon\n\nbreaking to pieces for the last time in his life.", "Whole now, white at the start\n\nof the evening, then gold with a dark horse-dragon, it floats over the former\n\npoet Ivan Nikolaevich and at the same time stays in place at its height.", "Ivan Nikolaevich is aware of everything, he knows and understands\n\neverything.", "He knows that as a young man he fell victim to criminal\n\nhypnotists and was afterwards treated and cured.", "But he also knows that\n\nthere are things he cannot manage.", "He cannot manage this spring full moon.", "As soon as it begins to approach, as soon as the luminary that once hung\n\nhigher than the two five-branched candlesticks begins to swell and fill with\n\ngold, Ivan Nikolaevich becomes anxious, nervous, he loses appetite and\n\nsleep, waiting till the moon ripens.", "And when the full moon comes, nothing\n\ncan keep Ivan Nikolaevich at home.", "Towards evening he goes out and\n\nwalks to the Patriarch\u2019s Ponds.", "Sitting on the bench, Ivan Nikolaevich openly talks to himself, smokes,\n\nsquints now at the moon, now at the memorable turnstile.", "Ivan Nikolaevich spends an hour or two like this.", "Then he leaves his\n\nplace and, always following the same itinerary, goes with empty and\n\nunseeing eyes through Spiridonovka to the lanes of the Arbat.", "He passes the kerosene shop, turns by a lopsided old gaslight, and steals\n\nup to a fence, behind which he sees a luxuriant, though as yet unclothed,\n\ngarden, and in it a Gothic mansion, moon-washed on the side with the triple\n\nbay window and dark on the other.", "The professor does not know what draws him to the fence or who lives in\n\nthe mansion, but he does know that there is no fighting with himself on the\n\nnight of the full moon.", "Besides, he knows that he will inevitably see one\n\nand the same thing in the garden
